            <div>
                <p>They were so alike, the <span class="place Amazon">Amazon</span> girls, that when <span class="name Hippolyta">Hippolyta</span> died, 
                    <span class="name Penthesilea">Penthesilea</span> felt she had been deprived of more than a sister.
                    She had lost her own reflection. For as long as she could remember, 
                    she had known what she looked like by looking at someone else: every shift in her own skin, 
                    every line, every scar almost, was matched on the body of the one she loved the most. 
                    And so as <span class="name Hippolyta">Hippolyta</span> fell - her face creased with pain, 
                    the arrow piercing her ribs - <span class="name Penthesilea">Penthesilea</span> knew that she was losing her sister and herself at once.</p>
                <p>They had always used weapons. Long before she could walk, 
                    <span class="name Hippolyta">Hippolyta</span> had taught <span class="name Penthesilea">Penthesilea</span> to sling stones across their mother's halls. 
                    The older they grew, the sharper the blades became: 
                    wooden swords and soft-wood spears were soon exchanged for the real things. 
                    And she had revelled in it. They both had. 
                    There was something so immeasurably delightful about being young and strong. 
                    The girls would ride for hours on near-identical horses: 
                    gentle trotting and then cantering and then galloping through the lower reaches of the mountains, 
                    their hair plaited tightly to hold it in place, pinned beneath their bright leather caps. 
                    They would dismount in the outskirts of the forest, and leave the horses, running until they collapsed on the ground, 
                    too breathless to groan at the pain in their lungs. 
                    They would lie amid the pine cones and look up at the sky between the upper branches of the trees, 
                    and know there was no one alive who was happier than them.</p>
                <p>And the games they used to play. Running up the slopes, picking up white pebbles,
                    or an abandoned birds' nest, running back to the bottom of the hill to add it to a pile of woodland treasures,
                    each one eyeing the other's growing hoard with envy, marvelling at her swiftness and strength. 
                    And the speed test, which <span class="name Hippolyta">Hippolyta</span> always won. 
                    The two girls would stand beside one another on open ground, and count themselves down: ready, steady, go. 
                    <span class="name Penthesilea">Penthesilea</span> would fit an arrow to her bow, and shoot it high in an elegant parabola.
                    At the same time, <span class="name Hippolyta">Hippolyta</span> would begin to run, 
                    laughing at her own ability to cover so much ground so quickly that by the time the arrow began to descend, 
                    she was waiting, ready to catch it in her hand. She never failed, until the last time.</p>
                <p>And so <span class="name Penthesilea">Penthesilea</span> had lost her sister, dearer to her than life itself. 
                    Not only that but she had killed her. 
                    An accident, the others said, trying to comfort her. 
                    As though there could ever be any consolation for this. 
                    And because she had lost the thing she held most dear, 
                    and because she had not merely lost it but had herself destroyed it, 
                    and because there was no possibility that she could go on living without <span class="name Hippolyta">Hippolyta</span>, 
                    <span class="name Penthesilea"></span>Penthesilea resolved to die.</p>
                <p>Death itself would not be enough, however. 
                    For the terrible crime she had committed she could face only one death: 
                    that of a warrior, in battle. Which battle it was did not matter particularly. 
                    The only requirement was that there must be a warrior skilled enough to kill her. 
                    Most men (<span class="name Penthesilea">Penthesilea</span> was not arrogant, merely aware of her talents) did not have the capacity to beat an Amazon in combat. 
                    There was one man, however, that even the Amazons spoke of in whispers. 
                    Quicker even than them, one had heard. The fastest warrior ever to fight. 
                    And so <span class="name Penthesilea">Penthesilea</span> took her women on the long journey south to the fabled <span class="place Troy">city of Troy</span>.</p>
                <p>The journey was not arduous for the Amazons, who were a nomadic people. 
                    Their horses were strong and they rode from dawn to dusk without ever growing tired. 
                    They slept only briefly during the hours of darkness and began their journey again as the sun rose the next day. 
                    If her women wished to stop their princess - to beg her to reconsider her plan to die - they respected her too much to do so. 
                    They rode alongside her, and they would fight alongside her. If she was resolved to die, they would die alongside her too.</p>
                <p>Their arrival was not a complete surprise to King <span class="name Priam">Priam</span>, whose scouts had heard a rumour that the women were coming south. 
                    Two Trojans rode out to meet <span class="name Penthesilea">Penthesilea</span>, and ask her intentions. 
                Whose side did she intend to take, in this, the tenth year of war on the <span class="place Scamandrian plains">Scamandrian plains</span>? 
                    Greek or Trojan? Were the women aggressors or defenders? 
                    <span class="name Priam">Priam</span> had sent two large gold tripods and jewel-encrusted bowls to try and win an alliance with the Amazons. 
                    <span class="name Penthesilea">Penthesilea</span> accepted them without a second glance. 
                    She cared nothing for trinkets what use were baubles for a woman who lived on horseback?  
                    but she did not wish to give offence by refusing them.</p>
                <p>'I'll fight for your king,' she said. 'Ride home and tell him the Amazons will fight the Greeks, 
                    and that I will fight <span class="name Achilles">Achilles</span>, and I will kill him, or die in the attempt.' 
                    She did not add that these two outcomes were equally desirable to her. 
                    The scouts bowed and sought to flatter her with desperate thanks. But she bustled them away. 
                    She did not need to know that <span class="name Priam">Priam</span> was grateful for her support. 
                    Of course he was. The story of what had happened to his son, to brave <span class="name Hector">Hector</span>, 
                    the Trojans' greatest warrior, had penetrated even the northern reaches of her Scythian home: 
                    how <span class="name Hector">Hector</span> had defended his city for ten long years, and how he had led his men in many famous victories.
                    <span class="name Penthesilea">Penthesilea</span> knew, everyone knew, 
                    how he had once fought a man dressed in <span class="name Achilles">Achilles</span>' armour and killed him; 
                    how for a brief moment the Trojans believed that <span class="name Achilles">Achilles</span> himself was dead, 
                    and how they pushed the Greeks all the way back to their camp, the greatest day of fighting in the whole war. 
                    But then <span class="name Hector">Hector</span> stripped the armour from the fallen Greek to discover - incensed - 
                    that it was not <span class="name Achilles">Achilles</span>, 
                    but rather another man, <span class="name Patroclus">Patroclus</span>, wearing <span class="name Achilles">Achilles</span>' arms and fighting in his stead. 
                    The rage of <span class="name Achilles">Achilles</span> when he heard of the death of his friend was instant and implacable; 
                    she knew how he had roared like a mountain lion and sworn his revenge on <span class="name Hector">Hector</span> and any Trojan who crossed his path. 
                    He was as good as his word, and stalked through the battlefield, mauling every man he saw, until <span class="name Hector">Hector</span> stood before him. 
                    <span class="name Penthesilea">Penthesilea</span> knew how he slaughtered <span class="name Hector">Hector</span> - thick, 
                    black arterial blood spattering on the mud beneath their feet - and screamed his savage joy. 
                    How he mutilated the corpse of his enemy, and tied leather thongs through his feet, turning man into carcass with no thought for the impiety of his actions. 
                    How he drove the body of the Trojan prince around the walls of his own city, 
                    dragging the battered corpse three times past the eyes of his broken parents, his pitiful wife, his uncomprehending infant son.</p>
                <p>Of course <span class="name Priam">Priam</span> was grateful for a friend in the Amazons. The man had nothing else left.</p>
