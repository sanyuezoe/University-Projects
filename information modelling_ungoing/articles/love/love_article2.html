  <p> In Chapter One I traced the burgeoning use of feminist critical theories in Classical methodologies, tracking the development from examinations of women in the 1970s, 
    through analyses of gender in the 1980s to the influence of contemporary post-feminist and queer theories from the 1990s onwards. The aim of this chapter is to examine 
    the representation of gender in Girl meets boy with particular reference to the direct influence of queer critic Judith Butler’s theoretical work Gender Trouble, a quote 
    from which appears as an epigraph to Smith’s novel. 
    I also discuss affinities of style with the lesbian experimental writing of Monique Wittig.</p>

    through analyses of gender in the 1980s to the influence of contemporary post-feminist and queer theories from the 1990s onwards. The aim of this chapter is to examine the 
    representation of gender in Girl meets boy with particular reference to the direct influence of queer critic Judith Butler’s theoretical work Gender Trouble, a quote from 
    which appears as an epigraph to Smith’s novel. I also discuss affinities of style with the lesbian experimental writing of Monique Wittig.</p>

  <p> In <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s original, ambiguities of gender are hinted at; that is, that if it were not for the wedding, <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> would be able to continue living her life as a ‘male’ despite
     her biological sex, perhaps hinting at the idea that gender performance may be primary to sex in identity. Examined from a postmodern perspective, these ambiguities disrupt
      the normative In <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s original, ambiguities of gender are hinted at; that is, that if it were not for the wedding, <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> would be able to continue living her life as a ‘male’ 
      despite her biological sex, perhaps hinting at the idea that gender performance may be primary to sex in identity. Examined from a postmodern perspective, these ambiguities disrupt
       the normative categories of sex, gender and sexuality and allow for pluralities of identity and sexual subjectivity.
       Although a radical feminist perspective would claim that <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> has rendered the female homoerotic experience invisible to us, a Foucauldian analysis of gender allows <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> to invite us 
       to speculate on the love that could be between the two girls,61 but, in his tale and Roman context <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ biological sex must change for there to be a happy ending. The Roman phallocentric 
       gender model does not allow for any other notions of sexuality based on sexual object-choice, and <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ bodily transformation into a boy ultimately shuts off the possibility of an alternative sexuality.62</p>
  <p> Robin (<span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>) addresses this difference in context as she narrates the tale from the Metamorphoses to her lover <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> (Ianthe). Her comments function at a meta-fictional level as well as applying to her version 
    of the tale, particularly when she notes that she is ‘imposing far too modern a reading on it’ (91) and that a lesbian sub-text is ‘debatable. But it’s not in the original story’ (95). <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> says of <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s tale that
     his version was simply ‘the way of the world’ (91) two thousand years ago, and that ‘he can’t help being the Roman he is, he can’t help fixating on what it is that girls don’t have under their togas, and it’s him who 
     can’t imagine what girls would ever do without one.’ (97)</p>
  <p>As Chris Beasley notes, ‘gender in Western society refers to a binary division... to the point of this division even being construed as oppositional’,63 and often, I would add, mutually exclusive. Feminists remain divided 
    over the issues of sex and gender, as whilst Susan Bordo (1990) believes that politically there is a need for such a unifying identity category as ‘woman’ (despite the fact that constructions of gender vary considerably 
    across cultures and time), feminist Linda Nicholson (1994) thinks that such categories exclude those who do not fit so definitively into them. Elizabeth Spelman (1988)64 and poststructuralist queer theorists such as Judith
     Butler (1999) and Ann Ferguson (1990) believe strongly in the fluidity and instability of gender categories and suggest that we should discard gender categories altogether.
  </p>
   <h4>Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble</h4>
  <p>In Gender Trouble, Butler argues against any set notions of a binary division of ‘man’
    and ‘woman’ based on essential qualities and draws on the theories of Michel Foucault to argue that humans are simply social products organised by societal discourses and power relations.65 Discourses are expressions of 
    power as they have the power to define individuals in particular ways and the power to oppress people because they do or do not fit into particular categories, but these discourses vary according to time and place. Thus,
     as a continuous discursive practice and an effect of social discourse, gender is an unstable category; that one becomes a gender through these discursive practices Butler terms ‘performativity’.</p>
  <p>Girl meets boy, as well as being a lesbian retelling of a classical myth, can be read as a fictional account of Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble; key points of her gender theory are acted out for us by the characters, 
    demonstrating the true instability of gender categories - particularly over time - and the fallacy of the existing rigid, binary model of gender that assigns aspects of a person’s behaviour or attributes to one of two 
    definitive genders. Smith’s <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> and Ianthe ‘trouble’ received notions of gender and sexuality and demonstrate the fluidity of gender categories espoused by queer theorists. Butler herself wonders how best we can begin
     to transform and ‘trouble’ set notions of gender and sexuality66 and I want to suggest that Smith in effect answers Butler’s call to arms. As Butler states in the preface to the second edition of Gender Trouble:
    I sought to counter those views that made presumptions about the limits and propriety of gender and restricted the meaning of gender to received notions of masculinity and femininity... I opposed those regimes
     of truth that stipulated that certain kinds of gendered expressions were found to be false or derivative, and others, true and original... the aim of the text was to open up the field of possibility for gender... 
     Is the breakdown of gender binaries... so monstrous, so frightening, that it must be held as definitionally impossible...? (Butler 1999: viii-ix) This troubling of gender and of the notion that gender follows 
     biological sex can be seen most strongly in the character of <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> in Girl meets boy, and is highlighted particularly at two points.</p>
   <h4>‘Troubling’ gender</h4>
  <p>The first is a scene between <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> and <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span>, <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span>’s sister, which plays out
    Foucault and Butler’s theory that language and definitive naming categories of gender and sexuality are societal devices of control and power to enforce compulsory heterosexuality.67 <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span> has been mentally 
    wrestling with her sister’s apparent transformation from ‘straight’ to ‘lesbian’, and has been struggling to ‘name’ her sister, to find a category into which she can be placed.68 Concerned with <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’s androgynous 
    name (Smith 2007: 55) <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span> asks <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> to tell her what the ‘correct’ word for her is (‘I need to know it. I need to know the proper word.’ 77), to which <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> replies, ‘The proper word for me... is me.’69 Through <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span>, 
    Smith is exploring the desire to classify; <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span> is not trying to impose heterosexuality here, but is looking for a definition, and in doing so exposes to the reader the inadequacies of language to do this.70 Through <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>,
     Smith is also playing with the notions of subjectivity and subject knowledge, a topic I return to in my discussion of Wittig in Chapter Three. In contrast, <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> cannot find a name for herself, and feels that she is
      prodigiosa novaeque (‘monstrous and new’, Met. 9.727), nor can she find an example of herself in myth71 (although we must remember that <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ subjectivity is being constructed for her by a male author).</p>
  <p>The second important scene that ‘troubles’ received notions of gender is <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span>’s description of <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>, which celebrates the undefined ‘grey areas’ of sexuality and gender and challenges the notion of ‘gendered attributes’.
     Personal attributes and behaviours are normally labelled ‘male’ or ‘female’ according to the current binary gender model, but Smith subverts the usual labels to show that such attributes are not really gendered at all. By doing so, 
     Smith challenges the existing gender model, not the behaviour: The grey area, I’d discovered, had been misnamed: really the grey area was a whole other spectrum of colours new to the eye. She had the swagger of a girl. She blushed 
     like a boy. She had a girl’s toughness. She had a boy’s gentleness. She was as meaty as a girl. She was as graceful as a boy. She was as brave and handsome and rough as a girl. She was as pretty and delicate and dainty as a boy.</p>
  <p>Smith is following the ambiguity and androgyny in <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> here, where <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> is described as ‘beautiful whether judged as a girl or a boy’ (facies, quam sive puellae/ sive dares puero, fieret formosus uterque, 712-3). <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ very survival 
    depends on this fluidity of gender, and her androgyny creates the dynamic of <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s story, as does our introduction to <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> that ‘She was the most beautiful boy I had ever seen in my life’ (45). <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> himself also troubles the notion 
    that gender follows biological sex; <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ sex may be female, but her gender is male – she has been given a unisex name, has been raised and dressed as a boy (709-712), and loves a girl. This is part of a larger comment throughout <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s
     work on Roman ideas of masculinity; <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> sympathises with <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ plight of not ‘fitting’ her sex, for as a self-styled lover rather than a soldier he presented himself in his poems as not conforming to the Roman male ideal. As <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> says 
     (of society’s rigid categories of sex and gender) ‘It’s easy to think it’s a mistake, or you’re a mistake... when everything and everyone you know tells you you’re the wrong shape...’ (97), directly recalling <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s prodigiosa.</p>
  <p> Butler states that society controls gender categories through ‘the regulation of [personal] attributes along culturally established lines of coherence’ (Butler, 1999: 33), and thinks that the fact that one can describe a man as having
     feminine attributes or a woman as having masculine attributes without disturbing the integrity of their gender demonstrates that gender identity does not follow automatically from biological sex, which itself is also discursively 
     constructed.73 Whilst I agree with Butler that the notion of fixed gendered attributes is a fallacy, we unfortunately live in a society using gendered binary language, so subverting this language as Smith has done is certainly a 
     good start at breaking down these gendered adjectives and assumptions. We can compare this with Monique Wittig’s feminisation of nouns and adjectives that would normally be masculine in French throughout Le Corps Lesbien, from the
      very first ‘body’ of the title: the male noun le corps is subverted with the incongruous qualifier lesbien, here in a masculine form. The title is incongruous as a lesbian body can only be a woman’s body, yet Wittig claimed that 
      lesbians are not women as female bodies are defined as the Other in the phallocentric, heterosexual paradigm of sex and gender, a paradigm that lesbians are outside of.</p>
  <p>Further subverted images and similes can be found throughout Smith’s novel, for example, the graffitied sign at Pure is described as having been ‘very prettily defaced’ (30), and Daniel Craig in Casino Royale is described as
     ‘rising out of the water like that goddess on a shell’ (83). We must start to mix up gendered descriptions to highlight their irrationality and to include those individuals who do not fit into the simple either/or categories of
      ‘male’ and ‘female’, thus can we bring about a change in society as Wittig had hoped to do, using her writing as a means to a political end.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, Butler thinks that gender is a performance, ‘tenuously constituted in time75... a constituted social temporality... structured by repeated acts that seek to approximate the ideal of a substantial ground of identity, 
    but which, by their occasional discontinuity, reveal the temporal and contingent groundlessness of this “ground”’ (Butler 1999: 191-92). Those persons who, like <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>, play with these discontinuities are the ones who can truly begin 
    to transform society’s fixed notions of gender. Butler does not believe that gender performance is consciously done, but uses drag performance as an example to illustrate how everyone puts on the clothes and behaviour that society deems 
    suitable for their sex. In Smith we see more such examples; <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> is ‘tired of having to be anything at all’, worried that she is solely a social construct made up of her online identity on Facebook and MySpace pages (23), and she consciously
     puts on ‘the right kind of clothes’ (25) to go to work; and we see multiple examples of characters wearing the ‘wrong’ clothes, including <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> wearing a boy’s kilt (43) and Bonnie Prince Charlie disguised in women’s clothing.76</p>
  <h4>Gender fluidity in Girl meets boy</h4>
  <p> utting on the ‘wrong’ clothes is one way of being fluid in one’s gender, and the
    sympathetic characters in the story all display a certain fluidity in their gender; for example, the opening words of the novel are the kindly grandfather’s words ‘Let me tell you about when I was a girl’ (3), and <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span> tells Paul 
    (the only nice character working at their employer Pure) that one of the reasons she loves him is because he seems quite female to her (130). Positive examples of fluid gender categories are seen throughout Girl meets boy and are contrasted
     to the negative portrayals of those who are rigid in their performance of ‘male’ or ‘female’. We see the Suffragette “Burning” Lily dressed as a message boy to evade the police (15); <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span>’s description of <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> when she sees her for the first 
     time (‘She was the most beautiful boy I had ever seen in my life.’ 45) and of herself after meeting <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> as having ‘taken a whole new shape’ (81), again recalling <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>; and <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> and <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> variously tag their graffiti as ‘the message girls’ 
     and ‘the message boys’ (133-143).</p>
  <h4>Water imagery</h4>
  <p>We see a metaphor for gender fluidity in the water imagery throughout Girl meets
    boy. <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> watches the river flow and change before her (‘It laughed and it changed... As it changed, it stayed the same.’ 28); this reminds us both of <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s theme of metamorphosis, and the fact that <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ body changes while she, 
    and her love object, remain the same (her gender performance is primary to her sex in her identity). We see images of transgressed boundaries that are symbolic of transgressed gender behaviours, for example, <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> decides to go and sit by the 
    riverbank, but people walking on the bridge above look at her as if she is mad (‘Clearly nobody ever went down to the riverbank. Clearly nobody was supposed to.’ 26); no one dares trouble gender, except <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span>, who is beginning to explore 
    the ‘grey areas’. Smith is using the water imagery here and the riverbank to a similar effect as Shakespeare used woodland in plays such as A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Cymbeline as a symbol for a place where the ‘normal’ rules of 
    love do not apply (I discuss further how Smith views <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> through a Shakespearean lens in Chapter Five). Water imagery is a trope in feminist theory and literature as a metaphor for gender fluidity (for example Michèle Roberts’ people 
    who are as fluid as water, flowing past each other in peace and letting each other alone.’77) and to describe the rolling ‘waves’ of feminism, which Genevieve Liveley notes is a metaphor that conveys how each successive ‘wave’ of feminism
     is different, yet also inherently the same.78 <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> says of <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> that he is ‘very fluid’ (97), and <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> describes herself as ‘thirsting in the midst of water’ (mediis sitiemus in undis, 761); she is lost in the midst of both the
      waves of passion and of gender confusion. These images of fluidity are contrasted to the identically dressed and coiffured male employees of Pure whom <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> cannot tell apart (19); the gender stereotypes that appear on a poster for a 
      dating website, consisting of faceless cartoons (‘A nurse (female) and a policeman (male). That was one couple. A sailor (male) and a pole-dancer (female). A teacher (female) and a doctor (male)... The difference between male and female
       was breasts and hair.’ 31); <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span>’s rigid ‘female’ role at the start of the novel in her quest to be thin and her submissiveness in the face of men, and the misogynistic CEO of Pure, Keith, who only promotes <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span> because her perceived
        ‘feminine’ qualities would be good for the business (‘your natural instinctual caring talent... your ability to look good, look right’, 120-21). <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span> is a caricature of female submissiveness and subjugation, and Keith of male misogyny;
         Smith has employed gender stereotyping here to make a point that those who try to be ‘all male’ or ‘all female’ risk lapsing into parody.</p>
  <h4>Parody</h4>
  <p> Parody can also be used as a mode of gender disruption, and <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> employs parody,
    too; in <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ appeal to myth, he jokes that <span class="name Pasiphae" > Pasiphae</span> may have loved a bull but at least it was still a male able to give her satisfaction (femina nempe marem, 736).79 We can compare this to Dom’s comments: ‘See, that’s what
     I don’t get... there’s no way they could do it, I mean, without one... I mean, when men do it... at least it’s real sex they have, eh? But women... how can they?’ (69-70). ‘Freud defined it, Norman says,... as a state of lack. A state of 
     lacking something really, you know, fundamental.’ (69), and <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> puns, ‘A lass and a lack’ (76). (<span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> also jokes that when <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> is turned into a boy her ‘strength grows’, vires augentur, 788 – readers of <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s love poetry will recognise 
     the euphemistic vis/ vires, itself a subversion of Augustan masculinity - a joke later picked up by Apuleius who has Lucius’ only consolation upon being turned into an ass that natura crescebat, Ap., Met. 3.2480). <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> says that <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> is 
     fascinated by what <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> doesn’t have under her toga (97), and in her soliloquy <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> laments that her hope of ever loving Ianthe is foolish (stultos, 746), for she will never be able to touch her bride (nec mihi contingit, 761), and at
      the marriage ‘the one who leads is lacking’ (quibus qui ducat abest, 763); her love is therefore even more insane than <span class="name Pasiphae" > Pasiphae</span>’s monstrous liaison (furiosior, 737).</p>
  <p>It is important to note here that <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> often uses mythological exempla that comically serve to undermine his argument. For example, in Amores 1.9 <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> argues that all soldiers, indeed the greatest soldiers, are also lovers, citing 
    <span class="name Achilles" > Achilles</span>, <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> and <span class="name Mars" > Mars</span> as exampla. Yet these are terrible examples, as in each case the soldiers left the battlefield or neglected their duties as a result of a woman (<span class="name Briseis" > Briseis</span>, <span class="name Cassandra" > Cassandra</span> and <span class="name Venus" > Venus</span>, respectively). In his choice 
    of <span class="name Pasiphae" > Pasiphae</span>, <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> thus shows us that <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ love for another girl is, in fact, far from ‘monstrous’.</p>
  <p>Characteristically creating tension whilst being incredibly flippant, a few lines later <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> is at her lowest, cursing the fact that not even <span class="name Daedalus" > Daedalus</span>, with all his arts, could change her form from girl to boy (743-4). Sarah Annes
    Brown thinks we are meant to laugh at <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ lament to nature and particularly at her appeal to <span class="name Daedalus" > Daedalus</span>,81 and yet although such rigid gender categories are laughable to modern feminists and gender theorists (we are also meant to
     scoff at the misogynistic Dominic in Girl meets boy), we must always remember the potentially fatal consequences for those who do not conform to these categories</p>
  <h4>Lesbian literature</h4>
  <p>Smith’s standpoint as a lesbian author has shaped both the theory behind her
    rewriting of <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> and her writing style, and I will examine the theory first. Lesbian literary criticism looks at how a woman’s sexuality influences her writing style; Bonnie Zimmerman (1981) attempts to define the 
    characteristics of lesbian criticism and writing, and we can detect the elements she identifies both in the work of Monique Wittig (whom I discuss in Chapter Three) and Ali Smith. She wonders if lesbian feminist criticism 
    (and literature, I would add) is ‘a kind of imagination that can see beyond the barriers of heterosexuality [and gender] role stereotypes’ (Zimmerman 1981: 360), and this can clearly be seen in Smith. For example, the descriptions 
    of the fluidity of gender quoted above; and, after <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> and <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> have made love, <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> says that they were ‘both genders, a whole new gender, no gender at all’ (Smith 2007: 104).</p>
  <p>Often, lesbian literature is concerned with removing the stigma attached to lesbianism by associating it with positive and desirable attributes; here, the heroines of the tale are same-sex lovers, while those with homophobic attitudes
     are portrayed negatively (for example, the boorish Pure employees Dominic and Norman who call <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> a ‘fucking dyke’, 68), and the happy ending to the tale aims to dissolve some of the stigmas attached to gay culture voiced by the character 
     <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span>, that gay people are melancholy (56) , ‘are always dying all the time’ (58), and that her sister will have ‘a terrible sad life with no real love’ (56). As well as re-writing Classical myths, Smith is also re-writing the socially constructed 
     twentieth-century myths about gay people. As a weary-sounding Smith notes in an interview with Isobel Murray:
    I know what happens to gay characters. I know what happens to them in soaps; I know what happened to them in A. L. Kennedy’s Everything You Need, I know what happens to them in books; I know what happened to them in Alan Spence’s 
    marvellous Way To Go, which is that the gay character dies. The gay character dies, the gay character dies, the gay character dies. (Murray 2006: 226)
    Some lesbian literature is overtly political, connecting lesbianism to resistance to patriarchy, and whilst Girl meets boy is predominantly a love story, <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> and <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> are feminist political activists, painting feminist slogans
     that highlight the statistics of domestic violence, wage discrepancies and female infanticide. We also see recurring images of female resistance and strength throughout the novel, for example, Flora MacDonald, and the war memorial 
     in London where the empty men’s clothes hint at the form of the women beneath that once wore them, leaving their traditional domestic roles to help the war effort (114-15).</p>
  <p>Smith rewrites <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> here with a feminist agenda, for if we ignore the pun and take <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> literally here, <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ father Ligdus had claimed that girls ‘lack strength’ (uires fortuna negat, 677), and when <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> is turned into a boy
    she gains strength, suggesting that this is what distinguishes boys from girls – yet Smith’s girls all exhibit strength, and even <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span> stands up to her boss in the end.
    Zimmerman further argues that lesbian feminist criticism/ writing’s exploration of the flexible boundaries of gender has often led to a fascination with costuming, that is, putting on the dress ‘suitable’ for a boy or a girl 
    (conscious gender performance). Girl meets boy contains many of these references; the story itself is a retelling of a tale about a girl dressed as a boy to save her life; the novel opens with a story about girls dressing as
     boys to help a political fugitive escape; in <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span>’s hometown of Inverness a statue to Flora MacDonald recalls her dressing Bonnie Prince Charlie in girls’ clothes to aid his escape; the first time we meet <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> in the text
      she is wearing a boy’s kilt, the quote from John Lyly in the epilogue is taken from his play Gallathea, a story about two girls disguised as boys to save them from a religious sacrifice, and the character ‘<span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span>’ recalls 
      the <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span> of Shakespeare’s Cymbeline, yet another girl disguised as a boy for protection.</p>
  <p>These repeated images of costuming are bound in with stories of escape and rescue that warrant our attention, and may be explained by Zimmerman’s analysis that lesbian writing has repeated imagery of imprisonment, ‘images of 
    violently imposed barriers, the closet’. She asks, ‘is there a dialectic between freedom and imprisonment unique to lesbian  writing?’82 We see this interplay between freedom and imprisonment throughout Girl meets boy; <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span> 
    feels trapped by the female role that society expects of her, but later feels elation when she quits her job and joins her sister’s campaign of political activism; <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> and <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> are literally imprisoned for their feminist 
    graffiti slogans, and the characters debate the morality of bottling water (symbolic in Girl meets boy of bottling the imagination, or restricting one’s definitions of love, sexuality and gender).</p>
  <p>At the conclusion of <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ tale in <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>, her dilemma is solved by a deus ex machina and her sex is reconciled to her gender by the goddess <span class="name isis" > isis</span>, but Smith subverts both gender stereotypes and literary conventions in
     the resolution of her novel. In the final chapter the two lovers are married, the conventional conclusion to any comedy of errors. However, as the feminist literary critic Jean Kennard (1978) demonstrated, the marriage
      which typically ends such works ‘indicates the adjustment of the [female] protagonist to society’s values, a condition which is equated with her maturity’ and as a consequence the heroine sacrifices precisely those
       ‘virtues of independence and individuality... we have been invited to admire’ (Kennard 1978: 14).
    Kennard sees all literature as inevitably inscribed with the social institutions and power relations of its socio-historical context, and sees literary conventions such as a concluding marriage working to show ‘the
     inferiority and necessary subordination of women’ in the past. For example, the works of the Brontë sisters and Jane Austen are often hailed by feminists as seminal proto-feminist texts in their use of female protagonists
      and their depiction of the universal female voice, yet their characters are still ultimately subordinated through marriage. Smith both plays to convention and defies it in <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> and <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span>’s wedding as here the power 
      relationship is balanced. In fact it is the characters around them that have reached maturity, particularly <span class="name Imogen" > Imogen</span>, who finally accepts her sister and herself for who each of them really are. Such a marriage is directly
       contrasted to the ending of Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre with the subverted line, ‘Reader, I married him/ her.’ (149)

    <h4>Monique Wittig</h4>
  <p>I will now examine aspects of Smith’s style in her rewriting of <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>. The scene
    describing <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> and <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’s lovemaking (101-105) is strikingly similar to Monique Wittig’s Le Corps Lesbien and is a beautiful example of lesbian experimental writing as outlined by Zimmerman above. Smith’s style in this 
    scene becomes more like poetry than prose as conventional methods of punctuation are discarded and the vivid images pour out in a continuous stream of consciousness. The words raise the reader up and lower them down, mimicking
     the rhythms of their lovemaking.83 Like Girl meets boy, Le Corps Lesbien is a love story, and also makes use of feminised mythical characters, for just as Smith’s <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> remains a girl, Wittig’s Osiris is a woman</p>
  <p>In her essay ‘Some remarks on The Lesbian Body’, Wittig admits to borrowing from <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s Metamorphoses for her own imagery, as it is a work ‘assimilated into the reader’s mind with violence’ (Wittig 2005: 46). She notes that
     in <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>, as with ‘all the great lovers of heterosexual culture’, the lovers are rapists or murderers, ‘for what is total ecstasy between two lovers but an exquisite death?’ (46-47). Like Smith, Wittig thus borrowed yet subverted
      <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s violence, as from the violence of passion the lovers merge/ emerge and create a new being; both Wittig’s and Smith’s lovers are resuscitated and rescued.
      Wittig’s work is a paean to the female body, and makes use of a range of poetic forms and moods throughout the book, from highest passion to deepest rage. The violence and dismemberment throughout Wittig’s text is also symbolic of
       the tearing apart of the normative categories of sex, gender and sexuality, and the disruption of the male language to create this new woman’s writing; Smith employs dissonant adjectives and fluid gender roles to similar effect. 
       We can compare the following two passages to demonstrate this unconventional grammar, the broken syntax and passages of prose poetry, and which both contain similar images of the lovers united, merging into one being (again recalling
        <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> – a lesbian version of Hermaphroditus):</p>
  <p>You turn m/e inside out, I am a glove in your hands, gently firmly inexorably holding m/y throat in your palm, I struggle, I am frantic, I enjoy fear, you count the veins and the arteries, you retract them to one side, you reach the 
    vital organs, you breathe into m/y lungs through m/y mouth... (Wittig 1973: 86)</p>

  <p>I was a she was a he was a we were a girl and a girl and a boy and a boy, we were blades, were a knife that could cut through myth, were two knives thrown by a magician, were arrows fired by a god, we hit heart, we hit home,
     we were the tail of a fish were the reek of a cat were the beak of a bird were the feather that mastered gravity were high above every landscape then deep down in the purple haze of the heather were roamin in a gloamin in a brash 
     unending Scottish piece of perfect jigging reeling reel can we really keep this up? (Smith 2007: 103)</p>
  <p>Susan Wolfe proposes that ‘lesbian literature is characterised by the use of the continuous present [tense], unconventional grammar and neologism... it breaks boundaries between art and the world, between events and our perceptions 
    of them, and between past, present and the dream world.’ This is not a definitive rule, but there sometimes is a strong correlation between lesbian and experimental writers. Although Smith is using the past tense in this scene, the
     same sense of continuous action as in Wittig is conveyed through her extended sentences. We can also compare <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s repeated use of participles and the present subjunctive tense in <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ speech (roganti, 9.752; fiant, 9.753; laborent, 9.754); 
     again the sense of immediacy and on-going action strengthens <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span>’s creation of <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span>’ subjectivity and pulls the reader into her world.</p>
  <p>Judith Butler writes that if, as Monique Wittig argued ‘gender itself is naturalized through grammatical norms... then the alteration of gender at the most fundamental epistemic level will be conducted, in part, through contesting the grammar 
    in which gender is given’ (Butler 1999: xx). As such, Wittig’s ‘I’, j/e, is split, and as their love-making winds down <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> finishes her flowing prose poetry with the proclamation that they were ‘both genders, a whole new gender, no gender at 
    all’ (104).</p>
  <p>Wittig was a materialist feminist who believed that language is ‘a material, transformative element of social praxis’, and as such wanted to break away from Cixous’ écriture féminine (which she felt still bound women to conventional notions of
     the female body as a site of biological reproduction) and create her own revolutionary writing, a ‘material production, a transformative act of labour and a conscious intervention within history’.85 Through her experimental creative writing Wittig 
     creates a lesbian subjectivity that she felt had not been represented before; for Wittig, desire is identity, and desire creates subjectivity – her desiring subjectivity is primary to her sex or gender. Her self- positioning as a lesbian writer is an
      attempt to find subjectivity ‘beyond the categories of sex’.86 Smith, too, is using her writing to change public perceptions of gender and sexuality, and <span class="name Iphis/Robin" > Iphis</span> herself says that her life only began, her subjectivity created, when she fell in love with
       <span class="name Anthea" > Anthea</span> (85).87 In exploring the fluidity of gender categories Smith ‘move[s] beyond a ‘feminist’ response, to create responses that transcend gender’.</p>
  <p>Wittig wanted to write about the wholeness of the female body and female erotic experience, so rather than using the conventional markers of desirability in male discourse such as breasts and hips (as she felt Cixous had done), she writes of organs,
     of veins, of hands. Likewise, Smith does not use these conventional markers of female desirability. For example, Wittig writes:</p>
  <p>You are m/y glory of cyprine m/y tawny lilac purple one, you pursue m/e throughout m/y tunnels, your wind bursts in, you blow in m/y ears, you bellow, your cheeks are flushed, you are m/yself you are m/yself (aid m/e <span class="name Sappho" > Sappho</span>) you are m/yself, I die enveloped 
    girdled supported impregnated by your hands infiltrated suave flux infiltrated by the rays of your fingers... (Wittig 1973: 50) and we can compare Smith:</p>
  <p>... I wasn’t sure whose hand that was by my head, was it hers or mine? ... Her hand opened me. Then her hand became a wing... her smile so close to my eyes that there was nothing to see but the smile... Her beautiful head... her teeth... her tongue... 
    my whole insides... I was sinew... the scent came into my head and out of my eyes, my ears, out of my mouth, out of my nose... I was eyes... chin... the insides of a mouth... (Smith 2006: 101-4)</p>
  <p>The repeated mention of hands in both of the pieces is an important use of symbolism, for hands are both the means of sexual pleasure and the tool of creative writing;89 Wittig is rewriting the lesbian body as Smith is rewriting <span class="name Ovid" > Ovid</span> (the word ‘hands’
     appears seven times in Smith’s lovemaking scene). The double pages throughout Le corps lesbien of capitalised body parts demonstrate the many parts and thus the wholeness of the female body and both adds a literal structure to the work and creates a theoretical
      framework of the female body.</p>
