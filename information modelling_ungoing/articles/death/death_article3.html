   <!-- Medea the Feminist, from pp 112 (13) onwards, 3.184 words -->
    <div>
        
       <p> <span class="name Euripides" > Euripides</span>' <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> is fascinating because of the power power of her hatred, because she refuses to become a victim. The modem <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>s devised by some feminists are often somewhat pale in comparison.
           A particular example of this is provided by the play Collateral Damage, subtitled The Tragedy of <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>." 
           The term 'collateral damage' was used during the 1991 Gulf War to describe the thousands of civilian deaths that resulted from the bombings in Iraq.
            I quote the words of the author of Collateral Damage, Jackie Crossland: '[T]he killing was shrugged off as an unavoidable consequence of the political and economic struggles over which those who died had no control.
            Similarly the women and children in this play are buffeted by circumstances over which they have no control. The tragic part of die story stems from this: a mother, <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>, is separated from her children by such circumstances and never gets to see them grow up.45 From this it is clear that the themes of this play extend beyond feminism, although feminist issues dominate. </p>
        <p>The play is set in an East Vancouver kitchen filled with utensils and toys such as in any house with children. This background underscores the author's belief that <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>'s story 'could be any woman's story'. 
            The cast is essentially the same as in the Greek tragedy, but <span class="name Aigeus" > Aigeus</span> is omitted, <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>'s mother features as a ghost while <span class="name Crayon" > Crayon</span>'s (sic) daughter, here called Princess, also has a speaking part. Ms Crossland's intention is that all the roles, including those of men, should be played by women, thus neatly subverting the practice in ancient <span class="place Athens " > Athens</span>. Masks are to be used. 
            This links with the idea that <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> is a woman's story with men presented as women see them.</p>
        <p>
            The male characters are portrayed as rather seedy political adventurers and male chauvinists. They are in charge because of their physical strength.
             When <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> arrives in <span class="place Colchis " > Colchis</span> in search of the Golden Fleece, <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> has already been abused by her father and her brother and welcomes the chance of escape. Nevertheless, her opinion of <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> is not high: 'This <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> is not a clever man.
              But he is brave in the way that men are and handsome ... He pays more attention to his muscles than my conversation, which he does not seem to understand most of the time. But  they say love is often like that and that a woman can't expect much."6 Later in <span class="place Corinth " > Corinth</span>, <span class="name Crayon" > Crayon</span> gives the reason why <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> would be a suitable son-in law thus:
               'This boy is as thick as two planks, but nobody messes with him."7 The female characters are much more intelligent and show great solidarity with one another, but are nevertheless wronged and suppressed. 
              For instance, in this play <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> kills <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>'s brother, but <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>'s father spreads the story that she was the murderer. </p>
        <p>Further evidence of female striving for personal realization is
            provided by the character of <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span>'s intended bride. Princess is
            independent-spirited and does not wish to marry <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> when her father instructs her to do so. She reacts: Ί see what this means for me. I must
            marry this guy and start making babies to consolidate your position."8 Princess is forced by <span class="name Crayon" > Crayon</span> to marry <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> and he rapes her. When he falls asleep, she gets up, sets fire to the marriage-bed and goes to the women's temple where <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> has also sent her maid with the children.
             <span class="name Crayon" > Crayon</span> has the women's temple destroyed, but Princess as well as <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>'s maid with the children manage to get away safely. The children are brought up by the maid who regrets that their mother does not know they are safe and well. <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> lives a lonely life, mourning for her children.
             In spite of this, 'stories were circulated about her wickedness and enchantments. They say she killed the king's daughter with poison and murdered her own children.49 This is, of course, the Euripidean version that has just been shown to be false. In contrast to the triumphant supernatural being at the end of the Greek drama, this woman has become a victim.
              The message of Collateral Damage is unambiguous: Men are unscrupulous in exploiting women to fulfil their every need. Even while fighting for survival, women will be accused of perpetrating vile crimes.
             It is thus fitting that the play should end with the message: 'Mothers make your daughters strong.</p>
        <p>The theme of cynical political expediency indicated by the title again comes to the fore in <span class="name Crayon" > Crayon</span>'s strategy of choosing <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> as his son-in-law in order to have his military skill at his disposal. 
            The way in which he plans to remove <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> also illustrates this: Ί was thinking that I could make a  law that foreigners couldn't live here. ... Or, if push comes to shove, we could just kill her. Whatever it takes.51
            The combination of all these themes makes this play a good example of how the <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> myth may be manipulated to conform to ideas that are acceptable to die politically sensitive in the modem world.
            Another recent work that joins several themes in its interpretation of the <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> myth is the novel <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>-Stimmerf1 by the renowned German author Christa Wolf who was bom in the German Democratic Republic and spent most of her life under the communist regime. Her novel is set in the ancient world, but in the Prologue Wolf explicitly points to the similarities between the ancients and us. She calls them 'fremde Gäste uns
            gleich'.53 Thus the reader is invited to draw comparisons and apply conclusions to modem society. </p>
        <p>By means of six voices from the past - <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>, <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span>, <span class="name Agameda" > Agameda</span> (a former pupil of <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> who now hates her), <span class="name Akamas" > Akamas</span> (Kreon's first astronomer and the regime's chief spin doctor), <span class="name Glauke" > Glauke</span>, and <span class="name Leukon " > Leukon</span> (the second astronomer of the realm and a man who keeps aloof from the intrigues of the court) - the story of <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> is told in eleven chapters.
             The narratives of the 'voices' transmit the details of the story in a roughly chronological order. 
            The novel starts in <span class="place Corinth " > Corinth</span> at a time when tension is already high, but in the course of the description of events the past in <span class="place Colchis " > Colchis</span> is also depicted.</p>

        <p> Wolfs <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> is not guilty of any of the murders ascribed to her by <span class="name Euripides" > Euripides</span> and those who followed his version. Instead, she is presented as an exceptional woman, a wise woman and a healer who has the welfare of ordinary people at heart.
             She does not hesitate to expose herself to infection by the plague, which breaks out in <span class="place Corinth " > Corinth</span>, but tries to help the sick. However, <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> is in danger, not only because <span class="name Creon " > Creon</span> needs to have her removed so that <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> may marry <span class="name Glauke" > Glauke</span>, but because she has discovered that the state of <span class="place Corinth " > Corinth</span> is rotten to the core and that <span class="name Creon " > Creon</span>'s power was entrenched by the sacrifice of his own daughter.
              This forms a counterpoint to <span class="place Colchis " > Colchis</span> where king <span class="name Aeetes " > Aeetes</span> has sacrificed <span class="name Apsyrtus " > Apsyrtus</span> to consolidate his hold on power. 
            Ironically, <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>'s escape from <span class="place Colchis " > Colchis</span> and her father's brutal regime have brought her to a state which on the surface seems  prosperous and benign, but on closer inspection is totally corrupt. The
            position of women in both these states is that of subordinates. Additional
            themes are xenophobia, imperialism and the clash of cultures. In
            <span class="place Corinth " > Corinth</span>ian society, not only the Colchians who came as refugees with
            <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> are marginalized because of their brown skins, dark hair and
            different customs, but also the original inhabitants. These groups are
            huddled on the fringes of the city and excluded from participation in civic events.</p>
        <p>Both themes are linked to die overarching one of the manipulation of power and the effect power has on those who hold it.
             In both states, power is used to exclude women. Early <span class="place Colchis " > Colchis</span> is depicted as a kind of socialist state, ruled by men and women alternately in seven year cycles.
             <span class="name Aeetes " > Aeetes</span> was approaching the end of his second ruling cycle when the Colchian women were planning to install <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>'s sister as ruler, but <span class="name Aeetes " > Aeetes</span> engineered a scheme that implicated women in the slaughter of <span class="name Apsyrtus " > Apsyrtus</span> and thus discredited them as potential rulers</p>
         <p>In <span class="place Corinth " > Corinth</span>, <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> discovers evidence that, faced by a similar plan to replace the corrupt <span class="name Creon " > Creon</span> by his daughter Iphinoe, the king and his faction succeeded in eliminating her. <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> cannot be charged with discovering this secret because, according to the ruling party myth, it does not exist. Iphinoe has eloped to marry abroad, the official story goes. In order to discredit <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> and neutralize the threat that her knowledge poses, <span class="name Akamas" > Akamas</span>, officially first astronomer, but in fact chief of propaganda, spreads the rumour that <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> murdered her own brother in <span class="place Colchis " > Colchis</span>.
             Further charges are concocted against her and there is even a trial before she is formally banished without her children. This is reminiscent of trumped up charges and show trials in totalitarian states. Before she leaves <span class="place Corinth " > Corinth</span>, <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> entrusts her twin boys to the temple of Hera where she thinks they will be protected, but years later she learns that the Corinthians stoned them.
             As final blow she is told that the Corinthians have spread the report that she killed her own sons </p>
        <p>In Wolfs novel, <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> is exonerated of every act of homicide attributed to her. Although <span class="name Glauke" > Glauke</span> initially dislikes <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> because she would like to be <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span>'s wife, she is so distraught at the Corinthians' treatment of <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> that she commits suicide by jumping into a well. Of course, the Corinthians spread the story that she jumped into the well because <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>'s gift to her, a bridal dress, burnt her.
            Wolfs <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> is thus a tragic figure in a different way to <span class="name Euripides" > Euripides</span>  protagonist. She does not even attempt to exact any revenge, but becomes
            the victim of relentlessly corrupt political forces and consciously suffers
            the full implication of the heinous injustices served out to her. For this
            <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> there is no escape into a world of delusion like that of Seneca's
            heroine, who imagines that through killing her children she has restored her
            virginity, in other words, that she has cancelled her whole relationship with <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span></p>
        <p>Christa Wolf has managed to produce a totally new interpretation of the myth. Her <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> stands not only for die injustices suffered by women and groups who have been colonized or are regarded as racially inferior, but for all victims of one-party states where corrupt rulers fabricate rumours and stories to discredit their opponents, who are summarily tried and punished. Parallels in the modem world are not hard to find.</p>

            Most of the modem versions dispense with the flamboyant fi <span class="name Euripides" > Euripides</span>' tragedy, where <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> is ready to depart in a chario dragons. 
            Modem artists represent the aftermath of the horrify different, more realistic way. Their protagonist is left in the every and must accept the consequences of the events. Neil Labute's <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> Redux,54 starts with the <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> figure already in that positio start of this monologue, she is in an institution, probably a detenti making a statement for the record. Gradually it emerges that t was seduced by one of her teachers when she was thirteen yea abandoned when she became pregnant with his child.
             This a dimension to the exploitation of women and represents anothe theme of the modem media - child abuse. The bleak simplic narrative underlines the horror of the outcome. She brings up her s
            but, after a few years, again establishes contact by letter with the the first face-to-face meeting of father and son, on his fourteenth the mother understands, not only that the father loves his son, but he is happy 'because he had gotten away with it all.55 This is the tri releases her desire to punish her exploiter. 
            She kills the son sh electrocuting him in the bath. The play ends with the woman admitting that  the only thing that keeps her going is the thought of how 'he' (the father/teacher/exploiter) must be suffering. The very underplayed and restrained tone of the monologue with its shocking revelations shows how deeply disturbed the woman is.
             This is a counterpoint to the strong emotions and passionate language of most <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> dramas and subscribes to the notion aired in some of the other feminist adaptations (Albee, Crossland, Harrison) that any woman may become a <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>.  </p>
        <p> A similar elegaic tone is adopted by Diane Wakoski in her poem <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> the Sorceress.56 The narrator likens her decision to give up her baby in 'the Home for Unwed Mothers' to <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>'s decision to kill her children.
            Her action is prompted by the callous lack of support by her boyfriend, J, who has no scruples about writing to her about his adventures with other girls. Her description of her mundane life in different parts of the United States after this event is in ironic counterpoint to the 'dragonlady power' of <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>. Her references to other women abandoned by men define her story as the sad pattern of the lives of many women in the modem world. Although the sensationalism of the literal killing of a child or children may be absent, the grief at the loss is lifelong.
            Liz Lochhead,57 on the other hand, preserves the traditional Euripi dean ending in her adaptation of the <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> created for Theatre Babel and produced in Glasgow and Edinburgh in 2000. This <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> subscribes to the feminist view of the world. She starts the 'Women of <span class="place Corinth " > Corinth</span>' speech in a way that unambiguously makes her a mouthpiece for women: 'ladies of all time ladies of this place and others ...58 Nevertheless, she is shown taking full responsibility for killing her children.
             As in the ancient dramas, her motive is revenge, which is only softened by her claim that if she delayed the deed, 'another's hand not a mother's loving hand would kill my children'59</p>
        <p> 
            To <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> she expresses the vengeance she has exacted in shocking terms: Ί have torn out your heart and devoured it.60 Thus, at the end, <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> and <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> are left, but the unbridgeable chasm between them and the two approaches to life they represent are indicated when <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span> says, 
            'it's all over' and <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> replies 'it will never be over end of story.'6</p>
        <p> Unlike the feminist interpretations of Albee, Crossland and, to a certain extent Wolf who tum <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> into a soft, womanly character, Lochhead's <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> has all the fire and steel of the ancient <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>s. She
            does not spare Glauce whom Lochhead introduces in a speaking part in place of die Euripidean scene with <span class="name Aigeus" > Aigeus</span>. The destruction of Glauce is given an added dimension because she is presented as a woman in her own right who, somewhat naively, 
            does not want her happiness to hurt another woman. The Chorus have little sympathy for Glauce. Their feminism is robust and realistic. For instance, they are women 'of all times, all ages, classes and professions.62 They call <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> 'sister', use strong language and call themselves
             'all survivors of the sex war'. Their support for <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> falters only when she resolves to kill her children. However, 
            even when they have accepted that <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> is not to be stopped, they express pity for her and put the situation in perspective: We weep for you too <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> mother of bairns
            murderer of bairns
            mother murderer
            The adulterous husband in the other woman's bed.63</p>
        <p>  The understanding of the Chorus expressed in this way is a powerful statement. It implies that <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> is not a monster. What has happened to her, may happen to any woman.
            Lochhead's <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> does not exonerate the protagonist from any of the deeds ascribed to her and accepted as part of the myth since <span class="name Euripides" > Euripides</span>'
            <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> was first produced in 431 BC, namely the killing of her brother, the deaths of <span class="name Creon " > Creon</span> and <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span>'s new bride and the murder of her own children.
            Nevertheless, this play makes as strong a declaration for women as some  of the others where <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> is portrayed as a victim of slander and the killing attributed to others. <span class="name Euripides" > Euripides</span> and Lochhead both have <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> claiming the killing of Absyrtus as one of her services to <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span>, but Albee, Crossland and Wolf make others responsible. <span class="name Euripides" > Euripides</span> and Lochhead make the death of the princess the first part of <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>'s vengeance, but Crossland and Wolf alter that. Crossland annexes the princess to the women's cause, while Wolf lets her take her own life in despair. <span class="name Euripides" > Euripides</span> and Lochhead have <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> killing her own children to complete her punishment of <span class="name Jason" > Jason</span>, although, by this act, she is cruelly punishing herself too. Crossland and Nathusius deny that the children were killed, while Albee, Wolf and Nick make the Corinthians the killers. Readers and audiences have to judge for themselves which of these <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span>s - triumphant but anguished murderer, or wronged and slandered victim -
            makes the best figurehead for die feminist cause.</p>
        <p> It cannot be gainsaid that all the versions of the <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> myth discussed
            here force a reappraisal of the original version by <span class="name Euripides" > Euripides</span> and of the
            position of women in society. It is worth noting that of these new versions,
            nine are by women: Gloria Albee, Marie Cardinal, Jackie Crossland, Liz
            Lochhead, Marie-Sophie Nathusius, Dagmar Nick, Miranda Seymour,
            Diane Wakoski and Christa Wolf. This too indicates the important place
            <span class="name Medea" > Medea</span> has taken in the minds of creative women and what a potent icon she has become for women. </p>
