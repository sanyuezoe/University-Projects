    <body>
        <p><span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> saw the future as though it were the past. 
            It was not for her as it was for the priests who read signs in the flight of birds or the entrails of beasts. 
            From their murky pronouncements, you would believe the future was always swathed in cloud and fog, tiny strands of isolated brightness in the dark. 
            But for <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span>, it was as clear as a recent memory. 
            And so when she heard <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> say he would take her mother to <span class="place Thrace">Thrace</span>, 
            she knew what was to come, because for her it had all the clarity of something she had already seen happen.</p>
        <p>She felt a wave of revulsion rip through her and the familiar sour taste rising in her throat. 
            She did not dare vomit, as <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> would punish her for the mess, 
            her mouth curling in disgust as she slapped her daughter across the cheek. 
            <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> felt a flicker of heat from the tiny white scars on her brow bone, 
            from the time her mother had hit her while wearing her full ceremonial jewellery. 
            That gold was gone now, of course, stowed in the strongboxes of the Greeks. <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> swallowed two, 
            three times in rapid succession, took a deep breath and tried to focus on the faint taste of salt in the air. 
            Salt had always quelled the worst of her sickness.</p>
        <p>But how could salt take away the sound of those eyeballs popping, 
            the sight of black jelly pouring down a weather-beaten face? Her breathing became uneven. She pushed the vision away, 
            but every time she blinked, it was all she could see: ruined sockets and thick dark blood. She tried to come back to the present, 
            turn away from the future and be where she was. Sometimes she could walk herself back, 
            step by step from tomorrow to today, and the taking of each small step reduced her potent desire to scream.</p>
        <p>But this time she found that she could not travel backwards, only forward to disaster, 
            over and over again. She watched her mother leave her - was she, 
            <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span>, the last one to leave the shores of <span class="place Troy">Troy</span>? 
            She wanted to look around and check: where was <span class="name Andromache">Andromache</span>, where was her sister, <span class="name Polyxena">Polyxena</span>? 
            But she could only watch what played out in front of her: the following morning. It must be the following morning, mustn't it? 
            Because <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> had said to her mother that she would be leaving with him then. And her mother's expression, 
            as the Greek hero held out his arm to help her onto his ship, was almost triumphant. She still carried herself like a queen, 
            even if the queen wore a soot-stained chiton, torn in two places at the hem.</p>
        <p><span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> was preparing herself for the meeting with <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span>, <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> could see. 
            She took some brief solace when she saw that her mother was not alone. 
            <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> had taken a small group of <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span>'s serving-women along with her, so although she did not have her family, 
            she had the women whose company she had often preferred. 
            <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> wondered if <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> had been forced to barter with his fellow Greeks to take a whole gaggle of women, 
            or whether no one had cared where the old ones went. As she walked on Trojan ground for the last time, 
            her mother made no effort to hold <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span>, or kiss her goodbye. But <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> saw something in her eyes which was not familiar. 
            The exasperation which usually marked <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> was gone. She did not kiss her daughter, it was true. 
            But she did not kiss her because she feared the humiliation of breaking down in tears.</p>
        <p>The scene dissolved and reformed as <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>' ship landed high on the sands of the <span class="place Chersonese"> Chersonese</span> coast. 
            <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> knew it was <span class="place Thrace">Thrace</span> - a place she had never seen - as well as if she had grown up there. 
            Her visions were never wrong, never lacking in detail, even if she could not always understand them. 
            In the short time it took for <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>' men to disembark and put up a few small tents, 
            two messengers dressed in ornamental garb appeared from somewhere further inland. 
            They bowed before <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>, almost on their knees to ensure his favour for their king. 
            <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> might be the guest in <span class="place Thrace">Thrace</span>, but no one was under the illusion that his host - the king, 
            <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> - was anything other than desperate for his approval. The messengers paid no heed to the old women, 
            a little cluster of slaves. Why would they? 
            <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> felt the sour pressure in her throat once more and she pressed her tongue against the roof of her mouth. 
            Not now, not now, not now. She tried to focus on the sand beneath her mother's sandaled feet: 
            full of round grey pebbles and bright white shells which she would have liked to pick up so she could run her thumbnail across their neat ridges.</p>
        <p>She felt another rush of memory, like a blow to her stomach. But this was a true memory, even if it was not hers. 
            It was not the future she could sense now, this was the past. 
            Her mother was right near the spot where <span class="name Polydorus">Polydorus</span>' body had been rowed out of the bay, 
            into the open sea, before being dumped overboard with a few handfuls of stones stuffed into his tunic to weigh him down. 
            <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span>'s feet would stand in the footsteps of the men who had pushed the small boat out into the water. 
            She would be so close to <span class="name Polydorus">Polydorus</span> but yet too late. <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span>'s visions were always too late, even when they should not have been. 
            She had long since learned that no one heard the truth from her, that even if they listened, they did not hear.</p>
        <p>The men who had committed this impiety against her poor brother, <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> saw, had not realized that he would tip in the water, 
            the stones dropping from his clothes before he was an arm's length under the surface. 
            He should have sunk to the seabed, been eaten by fish, watched in silence by the sea-nymphs. But they had not weighted him down properly. 
            No wonder he had washed up a day later on the sands near <span class="place Troy">Troy</span>.</p>
        <p>She saw that his face had been battered long before he met the rocks on the Trojan shoreline. 
            Her beautiful brother had been beaten before he was killed by the treacherous Greek king, who had thought no one would ever find out. 
            <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> tried to cling to this - the unspeakable man's vicious motivation - as she watched <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> talking to his slaves, 
            telling them to invite their king to come and visit his tall ships, and be made welcome by the conquering heroes of <span class="place Troy">Troy</span>. 
            She watched the messengers scurry away, taking word to <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span>. She saw her mother's lips disappear into a thin line. She saw it all.</p>
        <p>Again the scene disappeared and this time it reappeared as <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> strode down the grass-tufted sand. 
            He was dressed in all his finery: a heavily embroidered robe, gold chains around his throat, gold rings on his fat fingers. 
            His thinning black hair was oiled in the Trojan style, 
            and <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> saw a spasm of distaste pass over <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>' face before he accepted the man's two great hands in greeting. 
            <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> could smell the suffocating sweetness of cinnamon and myrtle with which the man had scented his hair oil.</p>
        <p>'<span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>,' he said, smiling broadly. 'This is an honour.'</p>
        <p>'Yes, so your slaves led me to believe,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> replied. 'You have been anxious for news from <span class="place Troy">Troy</span>, it seems.'</p>
        <p>'Of course, of course,' said <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span>. 'We have sacrificed many heads of cattle in the hope of winning the gods' favour towards the Greeks.'</p>
        <p>'Generous of you,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> said. 'You didn't want to join the war effort yourself?'</p>
        <p>If <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> heard the faint edge in <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>' voice, he did not allow it to show. 
            'My Thracian kingdom is the bulwark of Greece,' he replied. 
            'I knew I must be sure to keep our dominance secure in case you needed our aid. I sent messengers to <span class="name Agamemnon">Agamemnon</span>, my lord. 
            He has always known we were ready to assist. He had only to send word.'</p>
        <p>'<span class="name Agamemnon">Agamemnon</span> never spoke to me of these messages,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> said.</p>
        <p>'He is such a private man,' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> agreed.</p>
        <p>'That hasn't been my experience at all. But no doubt you know him better than I do.'</p>
        <p><span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> saw <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>' men, going about their business. Building a small camp they knew they would never use. 
            No wonder they had found the Trojans so easy to trick, she thought. Duplicity was second nature to the Greeks, to these Ithacans. 
            They went about it as naturally as cleaning weapons or fetching water.</p>
        <p>'I know him only by his great reputation,' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> said. 
            'I suppose there is a temptation to fill in the gaps in one's knowledge by imagining what sort of man behaves in such a way.'</p>
        <p>'In what sort of way?' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> asked.</p>
        <p>'Refusing all offers of help so generously. Never wanting to impose on another man's good nature.'</p>
        <p>'Ah, I thought you were being modest, but I see you have spoken nothing less than the truth.'</p>
        <p>'I'm not sure I understand.' The black pupils of <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span>'s eyes were the only thing that conveyed his unease.</p>
        <p>'You really don't know him,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> replied. He laughed, and clapped the Thracian king on the shoulder. 
            And <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> broke out into a great bark of laughter himself, relieved to find he had not spoken amiss.</p>
        <p>'I bring more than just my own men to your fine shores today,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> continued.</p>
        <p>'Oh?'</p>
        <p>'Yes, I have brought an old friend to see you. We could not resist the chance for you to be reacquainted.'</p>
        <p>'Who can you mean?' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> asked. He turned this way and that, trying to pick out the unexpected visitor from the motley mass of sailors.</p>
        <p>'Ah, you will not find your friend out here on the shore,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> said. 
            'She awaits you in that tent.' He pointed to the grey cloth which had been stretched over a few poles to create a makeshift shelter.</p>
        <p>'She?' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> asked, his expression acquiring a lascivious tinge.</p>
        <p>'<span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span>, queen of <span class="place Troy">Troy</span>,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> said. His eyes were fixed firmly on the Greek king, who looked only slightly disconcerted.</p>
        <p>'It was not a crime to have friends in my own region.' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span>'s tone was quiet and measured.</p>
        <p>'Of course not. <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> said you had been a friend to her husband long before the war broke out.'</p>
        <p>Relief suffused the Thracian king's face. 'That's true,' he said. 
            'It is just as she told you. We were trading partners and more, bound by ancient ties of guest-friendship.'</p>
        <p>'As I hope you and I will be,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> said, patting him on the back once more. 'Before the sun sets on our ships today.'</p>
        <p><span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> nodded in delight. 'We shall be, <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>. We shall be firm friends.'</p>
        <p>'One more thing,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> said. '<span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> has confessed something to me, on the voyage from <span class="place Troy">Troy</span>.'</p>
        <p>'What is that?'</p>
        <p>'She sent away her young son to your safe-keeping.'</p>
        <p><span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> watched as <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> wrestled against his nature, to talk when he was nervous.</p>
        <p>'I . . .' He paused and looked out across the bay. 
            Even for those bound by the vows of guest-friendship, harbouring a young man from an enemy city might be a step too close to treachery for the Greeks.</p>
        <p>'Ah, I see I've made you uncomfortable,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> said. 
            One more pat on the shoulder and the Thracian king would be nursing bruises. 
            'I understand that you gave the young man shelter. It was your obligation to <span class="name Priam">Priam</span>.'</p>
        <p>'You do understand,' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> said. 'I did not choose for the boy to be sent here, but once he arrived . . .'</p>
        <p>'What could you do?' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> asked.</p>
        <p>'What could I do?' he echoed.</p>
        <p>'You could give the boy every comfort and bring him up as your own,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> said.</p>
        <p>'Yes,' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> agreed. 'I did just as you say.'</p>
        <p>'You have sons of your own?'</p>
        <p>'I do. Two boys. Younger than <span class="name Priam">Priam</span>'s son,' he said. 'They are just eight and ten years old. And already the older one stands so high.' 
            He placed his hand at the height of his heart. 'The younger one is shorter by barely three fingers' width.'</p>
        <p>'Ah, send one of your men to bring them here,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> said. 'I have left my own son at home. I would be happy to see your two fine boys.'</p>
        <p>'Of course.' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> beckoned one of his servants, and muttered instructions. The slave nodded and hurried away.</p>
        <p>'You might bring <span class="name Polydorus">Polydorus</span> as well,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> called after him. The slave froze and turned, gazing wordlessly at his king.</p>
        <p>'What?' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span>'s smile no longer hid anything.</p>
        <p>'That is his name, is it not? <span class="name Polydorus">Polydorus</span>? Ah, I can see from your confusion that I've made a mistake. What is <span class="name Priam">Priam</span>'s boy called?'</p>
        <p>The smell of fear was unmistakeable now.</p>
        <p>'No, you are quite right, quite right,' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> said. 'But I cannot send for him.'</p>
        <p>'Why ever not? His mother is here. It is his last chance to see her before she sails off to <span class="place Ithaca">Ithaca</span> with me. 
            Surely you would not deprive the boy of such a meeting?'</p>
        <p>'I would not, of course I would not.' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> thought quickly. 'But he is away, hunting in the mountains.'</p>
        <p>'The mountains?'</p>
        <p>'Yes, further inland. Several days' ride. He likes nothing more than a hunt.'</p>
        <p>'So odd. First I misremember his name, and then I imagine he has no taste for riding a horse. I was sure <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> said—'</p>
        <p>'No, no, quite right,' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> replied. 'He did not have a taste for hunting when he arrived here. But he has grown to enjoy it greatly.'</p>
        <p>'Ah, yes. Making up for the years spent penned behind the high walls of <span class="place Troy">Troy</span>, no doubt.'</p>
        <p>'Exactly,' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> said. <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> could see the sweat soaking through his thick embroidered robe. 
            The sour stench battled with the sweet cinnamon perfume and <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> felt as though her throat was closing up.</p>
        <p>'So his mother will not get her hoped-for reunion after all,' <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> said.</p>
        <p>'I fear she will not.'</p>
        <p>'But perhaps it will be worth it, to know he is living such a healthy outdoor life.'</p>
        <p>'I hope so.'</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Again the scene slid away. <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> blinked and saw the boys running behind the slave, running towards their father. 
            The younger one pointed at the high mast of <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>' ship. 
            He had never seen a vessel so tall and could not stop yammering to his brother, who adopted the expression of a man who has seen every type of ship before. 
            They reached their father, and were suddenly shy in front of all the strangers.</p>
        <p>'Papa, are these the heroes of <span class="place Troy">Troy</span>?' the older one asked. His expectations had not been met by this ragtag crew.</p>
        <p>'They are,' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> replied, lifting the boy up to his waist and then scooping up the other one in his right arm. 
            'What do you think <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>? Fine heroes of the future, yes?'</p>
        <p>'You echo <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span>'s words about her own son. I shall keep old friends apart no longer.' 
            He nodded to one of his sailors, who opened the flap of the tent and brought the women outside.</p>
        <p>'My dear friend.' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> turned to <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span>, dropping his boys gently to the ground and opening his arms. 
            'I would not have recognized you.' He strode forward to greet her, his boys alongside him. 
            All these unknown men on their shore had made them nervous, and they wished to be close to their father.</p>
        <p>'I have grown old in the years since you were last in <span class="place Troy">Troy</span>,' <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> agreed.</p>
        <p>'No, madam, I did not mean—'</p>
        <p>'You did, and I have no vanity left. It died in the war, like my husband and my sons,' she said. 
            'If you could have seen me even a year ago, you would have known me straightaway. It is grief which has left its mark on me, not time.'</p>
        <p>'Your losses have been great,' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> said.</p>
        <p>'They have been intolerable,' she replied.</p>
        <p>'It must have seemed so.'</p>
        <p>'It was so. It is so. I have long since been unable to bear the burdens which the gods have placed upon me,' she said. 
            'One loss after another. Just in the past year: <span class="name Hector">Hector</span>, 
            then <span class="name Priam">Priam</span>, then <span class="name Paris">Paris</span>, then . . .'</p>
        <p>'The gods have treated you most harshly,' he said. 'I will make offerings and beg them for mercy on your behalf.'</p>
        <p>'Will you?'</p>
        <p>'Of course. Madam, no one could see you and not wish to alleviate your suffering. 
            Why, even <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>, a long-held enemy of your city and the house of <span class="name Priam">Priam</span>, has brought you here to receive comfort from your old friend.'</p>
        <p><span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> shook her head slowly. Her maidservants gathered about her, clustering around <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span>. 
            'How can you speak to me after what you have done?' she asked.</p>
        <p>'Madam?'</p>
        <p>'Don't lie to me, <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span>. It is beneath me to listen to the words of a murderous, avaricious traitor like you. 
            Did you not have gold enough? Was this territory too small for you? Was your palace too cheaply made? Your shrines too shabby?'</p>
        <p>'I don't—'</p>
        <p>'<span class="name Priam">Priam</span> sent you a vast sum to look after our boy. Don't try to deny it and don't try to trick me, you old fraud. 
            I placed the gold in his pack myself. And if that was not enough for you,' she spat the words out, saliva landing on his embroidery, 
            'I would have given you the same sum again to keep my boy safe. 
            You had only to send word that he was worth so little to you. His worth was beyond gold to me. 
            The Greeks have all the treasure of <span class="place Troy">Troy</span> now anyway. What difference would it have made to me if the gold had come to a Thracian instead of a Spartan, 
            an Argive, an Ithacan?'</p>
        <p>'He is safe! What lies have you been told?' <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> cried.</p>
        <p>But <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> had no desire to talk further. There was a glint of metal, reflecting the rays of the sun, 
            though he must have closed his eyes to spare himself the sight of it. <span class="concept revenge">In a flash, <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> had dragged her small, 
            sharp blade across the neck of <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span>'s older boy. The blood spurted out indecently as two of her womenfolk did the same thing to the younger child.</span></p>
        <p>'I buried him with my own hands, <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span>,' she screamed. 'How dare you lie to me?'</p>
        <p>'What have you . . .' The Thracian king roared in horror, but there was more carnage to come. 
            <span class="concept revenge">As his boys spilled their dark life blood out onto the sand, <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> and her women turned their short knives on him. 
            They did not aim for his throat or his heart. As he tried to gather his sons in his arms, desperately willing life back into them, 
            the women instead plunged their blades into his eyes. His cries of horror mingled with howls of pain, 
            and the blood pouring from his blackened sockets pooled with the blood of his children. His slaves did not attempt to help him, 
            seeing themselves outnumbered by <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>' battle-hardened crew.</span></p>
        <p>'You wiped out my line,' <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> whispered. 'Now I have wiped out yours. 
            And I leave you alive to remember that had you not been a traitor, a murderer, a breaker of vows and deceiver of friends, 
            your sons would still be delighting you into your old age. You would have seen them grow up as you grew old. 
            Now you know that the last thing you will ever see was their death. I hope the gold was worth it.'</p>
        <p>She stood back from the butchery and nodded to <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>. 'Thank you.'</p>
        <br/>
        <p><span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> and his men began to load themselves back onto their ships, ignoring <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> - hunched over the bodies of his sons - nearby. 
            The king's roars subsided into sobs and then into helpless mewling. <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span> stared at him in contempt. 
            Every one of his men had been elbow-deep in the blood of his comrades more than once in the past ten years of fighting. 
            They had little sympathy for a traitor who took payment from the Trojans and would have brought up a boy from the royal household, 
            who might have grown up determined to avenge his father, his brothers, his city. 
            The Greeks could not afford to leave the Thracian king unpunished for his two-faced dealings. 
            <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span> had followed his instincts, which were to maximize profit wherever he saw the opportunity, irrespective of the cost to others. 
            That could not be allowed to stand. His punishment would remind any other Greeks who thought to betray their word that such behaviour was not tolerated, 
            at least not by <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>.</p>
        <p>As the last of his men boarded, he called <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> and her women to accompany him.
             <span class="name Polymestor">Polymestor</span>, hearing the name of his enemy, let go of his dead sons and turned towards the sound of the waves.</p>
        <p>'You will die before you ever reach <span class="place Ithaca">Ithaca</span>,' he shouted. 'You will drown in the seas and no one will mourn you and no one will mark your grave.'</p>
        <p><span class="concept death"><span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> stopped beside the ruined king. 
            'I have been dead since I buried <span class="name Polydorus">Polydorus</span>,' she said. 'It makes no difference where I fall.'</span></p>
        <br/>
        <p><span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span> took in jagged breaths, desperate to remain calm. 
            She closed her eyes and then opened them again in the present, to see her mother, her sister, her sister-in-law, all sitting beside her on the rocks, 
            just as they had been before she followed her mother to <span class="place Thrace">Thrace</span>. But then the scene began to play out from the beginning once more. 
            It was no less horrifying to see it again. More so, in fact, now she had seen so much of what was to come. 
            But still, one detail was missing, right at the beginning when <span clas="name Hecabe">Hecabe</span> first stepped onto <span class="name Odysseus">Odysseus</span>' ship. 
            She, <span class="name Cassandra">Cassandra</span>, was standing there on the sands of <span class="place Troy">Troy</span>, watching her mother leave. She could sense that <span class="name Andromache"></span> had already gone. 
            She could see other women - cousins and neighbours - heading off with different warriors to disparate kingdoms. She had accounted for all of them. 
            All except one. Where was <span class="name Polyxena">Polyxena</span>?</p>
        <p>The answer came to her in a rush. And this time she could do nothing to prevent the sickness overwhelming her.</p>
