            <h1>Art Nouveau Style</h1>
            <h2>A Brief Overview</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau">Art Nouveaustyle</a>  employed in this website draws inspiration from the late 19th-century artistic movement, 
              particularly the works of Czech artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Mucha">Alphonse Mucha</a>.</p>
            <p>Art Nouveau, also known as the Modern Style, 
              emerged as a significant artistic movement between 1890 and 1910. 
              It aimed to establish a wholly unique style that diverged from previous artistic eras, 
              breaking away from imitation. </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Key Features of Art Nouveau:</span></p>
            <p><span class="bold">Asymmetry</span>: Art Nouveau embraces asymmetry, avoiding the rigid symmetry of previous styles.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Plenty of Female Images</span>: Art Nouveau is characterized by an abundance of female images. 
              This aligns seamlessly with our website's focus on portraying women's images.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Sinuous Lines</span>: It features sinuous, flowing lines inspired by forms found in nature.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Decorative Organic Forms</span>: The style incorporates decorative elements derived from animals,
               flowers, and plants.</p>
            <br>
    
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">FONTS:</span></p>
            <P>Primary Font - <span class="bold">Rochester</span>: The primary font, 
              used for titles and the navbar.</p>
            <p>Our selection of the 'Rochester' font for our Art Nouveau-inspired project draws inspiration from the Art Nouveau movement's characteristic features. 
              While Art Nouveau didn't establish specific fonts, 
              it left a distinct mark on typography, emphasizing curved and organic shapes and a penchant for high ornamentation. 
              The 'Rochester' font aligns with these principles, with its flowing lines, ornate details, and elegant script.</p>
            <div class="img-combo">
              <img src="img/art-n-fontstyle.png" alt="Art Nouveau fontstyle">
              <p class="italic">Ver Sacrum illustration by Koloman Moser (1899)</p>
            </div>
            <p>By choosing 'Rochester,' we aim to capture the essence of Art Nouveau and infuse our design with a sense of vintage elegance and sophistication. 
              While the font may not be a direct product of the era, it serves as a bridge between the past and the present, 
              allowing us to create a visually pleasing and harmonious result. 
              It's our way of paying homage to Art Nouveau's timeless charm while giving our project a contemporary twist.</p>
            <p class="italic">Example of title in the Rochester font:</p>
            <div class="img-combo">
              <img src="img/Rochester.png" alt="Rochester Example ">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Secondary Font - <span class="bold">Antic Didone</span>: For regular text content.
            <p>strikes the balance between readability and Art Nouveau elegance. 
              Its soft, curved style ensures legibility while maintaining the vintage aesthetic.</p>
              <p class="italic"> Example of text in the Antic Didone font:</p>
              <div class="img-combo">
                <img src="img/Antic-Didone.png" alt="Antic-Didone Example ">
              </div>
            <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>In the Art Nouveau style, particularly exemplified by Alphonse Mucha's iconic works,
              color plays a pivotal role.he likes to use muted and earthy tones, 
              adds delicate and gentle accents to his works, 
              and usually draws inspiration from the natural world. 
              he also likes to use Gold and Metallic Accents to enhance the luxurious and ornate quality,  
              to highlight specific elements. </p>
            <div class="img-combo">
              <img src="img/musha-collection.png" alt="musha collection">
            </div>
            <p>Here are chosen colors for the style:</p>
            <p>The color palette employed in the website design aims to evoke a sense of softness and harmony.
               The primary background color, Light Pink (#f9efea), blankets the entire website, 
               enveloping it in a gentle and soothing ambiance.
               Complementing this, 
               various light shades are strategically integrated to maintain a soft and inviting tone throughout the site.</p>
            <p>To add depth and contrast, a range of different grey hues is artfully woven into the design. 
              These greys create a harmonious balance with the other colors, 
              providing visual interest while preserving an overall sense of tranquility.</p>
            <p>Notably, a touch of gold is introduced for the 'hr' element, 
              paying homage to the golden threads found in books of the Art Nouveau era. 
              This subtle gilded detail adds a touch of elegance and historical reference to the design, 
              enriching the overall aesthetic.</p>
            <div class="img-combo">

            </div>
            <br>

            <h2>Layout and others</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">LAYOUT:</span></p>
            <p>Incorporating nature-inspired elements is a hallmark of Art Nouveau. 
              In our design, we utilize floral and plant imagery to enhance the overall aesthetics:</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Floral Borders:</span> Flower and plant images are elegantly incorporated as borders for dropdown menus,
               lending a decorative and organic touch.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Cursor:</span> The cursor is designed to resemble a flower, 
              adding a unique and thematic element that aligns seamlessly with the Art Nouveau style.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Female Images:</span> Alphonse Mucha's iconic female images are featured as covers and button images,
               personifying glamour, modernity, and beauty, 
               which perfectly aligns with the Art Nouveau theme.</p>

          <div class="bauhaus-style">
            <h1 class="h1A" >Bauhaus Style</h1>
            <h2>A Brief Overview</h2>
            <p> The <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus"> Bauhaus </a>  movment as been a pivotal artistic movement in the history of western Art. Started as a way for young artis to evade the costrains of accademic
                art and to express a renovate sense of freedom, Bauhaus aim is to bring a renovate artistic tast in the ramping society of earli XX Century.
                Officially started in 1919, the movement call for a comprehensive and sparse approace to the art, because of this a large number of people started to experiment  different
                forms of art and supports. From painting to architecture, from waving to teather, the Bauhaus movement has shaped the beginning of what we now call modern society.</p>
          <p>Since the topics of this project are centred on the retelling of women perspective in the Greek mythology, we found appropriate to use a similar approach in the choice of the graphic elements. 
            Because of this we dig a bit 
            in the wast production of the Bauhaus-related artis and we found the works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunta_St%C3%B6lzl"> Gunta Stölzl</a> particularly interesting for our project. 
            Gunta Stölzl has been a German  textile artist whose works not only represent a perfect example of Bauhaus innovation, but also played a foundamental role in the transposition of visual art into the 
            realm of modern industrial  design. </p>
            <p>Since the homepage has to introduce the nature of the project, we display two of Gunta Stölzl most representative of  Bauhaus-inspired work, namely an experimental design fo a carpet and a painting .
                 The images in the "issue " section off the homepage are
                 display a photographic portrait of Gunta Stölzl, amnd one of her late drawing . The page dedicated to the "Death" issue once again display an artwork of Gunta Stölzl, but  this time it is a draft 
                 drawing showing the unfolding of the  artist's creative process.</p>
            <p>In the 'love' issue we decide to display an artwork of <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Klee">Paul Klee  </a>  titled 'the lovers', this painting better fit in the atmosphere of the greek
                 conception  of love we discuss, as well it give us the opportunity to Better represent the Bauhaus
                style beyond the production of a single artist.</p>
             <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">FONTS:</span></p>
             <p>For what concerns the choice of the font and text styling, we adopted the closest once we find similar to that used in the Bauhaus <a href="https://d2jv9003bew7ag.cloudfront.net/uploads/Left-Bauhaus-Manifesto-Poster-by-Fokiohero-via-fokiohero-deviantart-com-Right-Bauhaus-Art-Style-Poster-by-mtvenar-via-carlyvitolo-blogspot-rs.jpg"> manifestos</a> publications around 1919. Waving but regular shape are the main characteristics of the typing styles of these period, when
                rounded shape reflected the innovation of the bauhaus, especially in a high formalised context such as publishing.
                 Even if it was typical for these publication to display the text in a deconstructed and irregular 
                shape, we decide not to imitated these design, since it would have turned into hard to read paragraphs and a messy visual effect. Instead we kept an ordered square disposition that should mirror those in   Gunta Stölzl textile production. </p>

          <div class="lateXX-style">
            <h1 class="h1A">Late XX Century Style</h1>
            <h2>A Brief Overview</h2>

            <p>For the Late XX century theme, we choose to emulate a mid 90s famous website, namely Ebay (at that time still call Auctionebay) that was lunched in 1995.
                 Since the development of graphics for the web was really poor at that time, instead of just copy the website appearance, we pick up the most relevant characteristics and try to reshape them in a more pleasant way. 
                We identified the more peculiar feature of this period as a really hight color contrast between tex and background, specifically in the grey-black/green-blak range, as well as a very pixel-shaped font resembling 
                typewriter printing. 
                Text disposition is square-organised and really homogeneous.
                Image decoration was basically absent in the original website, nonetheless we took the license to add a couple of images; in other not to change the overall idea of an old website, we choose pixel-art-shaped minimal
                 logos for the issues headers and buttons.</p>
