            ><p>Catherine C. Marshall</p>
        <a class="link-article" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20688878">link</a>
        <p>Ilse Langner's Klytemnestra marks a change in revisions of <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> , wife of  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> . While authors have traditionally demonized the figure
        as a murderer or discounted her as a mother in mourning, feminist authors have reclaimed <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> in order to clear her name. Langner belongs to this tradition, but at the same time breaks free of it. Instead of justifying
        <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s murder of  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>, Langner focuses on the queen's deeds during her reign in My cene, where she has created an alternative society that denies the primacy of patriarchy and war. This article examines
        Langner's feminist revision of <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>. (CCM)</p>
        
       <p> The German playwright and novelist Use "Penthesilesia" [sic] Lang ner (1899-1987) quickly established herself as a feminist author with her first drama, Frau Emma kempft im Hinterland (Mrs. Emma Fights on
        the Home Front), which premiered 4 December 1929 in the Theater Unter den Linden in Berlin. This sobriquet, given to her by Alfred Kerr
        in response to her first dramatic attempt, alludes to the outspoken way in which she criticized men's roles in World War I and cried out for
        women's voices to be heard. While Kerr was certainly shocked by Lang ner's attack on war as a man-made bane, he conceded that "in es
        sence.. .she is right. She says: you, men, are to blame for the duration
        of the war" . </p>
       <p> From her childhood, Langner associated war and the mythology of heroism that inevitably accom
        panies it with the patriarchal world;1 her dramas, especially those based
        on female figures from Greek antiquity, reflect her disgust for the for mer and dissatisfaction with the latter. The feminist and female-centered
        perspective that gave Langner's career a strong start effectively halted her chances for being published when the National Socialists rose to power. Her first mythological drama, the comedy Amazonen (Amazons),
        Women in German Yearbook 14 (1998) 
        
         
        
        was banned from the stage shortly before its 1933 debut. Obviously the Nazis saw little humor in this allegory of their totalitarian regime.</p>

        <p> Of her seven completed mythological dramas, three Amazonen (1933), Dido (1938-41), and Klytemnestra (1937-47) exemplify Lang ner's search for an alternative society, one not based on patriarchy, war,
        or gender inequality. Of these, only the prose drama Mord in Mykene (Murder in <span class="place Mycene" > Mycene</span>), the earliest version of Klytemnestra,2 made it to the stage, debuting in October 1937 in the private Reueisches Theater
        Gera, where it enjoyed a very brief performance run. That this perform ance was allowed at all can be traced to its venue and its well-concealed 
        criticism of the war and the regime. Soon after its premiere, Langner began rewriting and refining Mord in Mykene as the verse drama Klytemnestra at the urging of Oskar Loerke. Unable to publish freely in Nazi
        Germany,3 Langner resigned herself to writing for the drawer until finding a publisher in the newly formed Aufbau publishing house in 1947. This later version of the <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> myth has yet to be per
        formed. After World War II, Langner continued to write and enjoyed some brief successes until her death. Although her career began to blos som in the late 1920s and early 1930s, she was unable to recover from the years of relative silence imposed by the National Socialist regime. Langner enjoyed the respect of her colleagues and critics, but was never
        able to regain the audience her works had enjoyed before 1933. Langner's works, despite decades of praise from critics, have only
        recently sparked interest. In the last ten years, scholars have become increasingly aware of her contributions to German and world literature, as well as to German feminist thought. The most significant contribu tions to the study of Langner and her oeuvre have been made by Inge
        Stephan, Anne Sterzer, and most recently Helga Kraft.4 Each of these scholars has provided an invaluable addition to Langner scholarship, but
        because of the limited scope of their studies, none has offered a com plete picture of the author and her work. Stephan was the first scholar
        to address Langner within the framework of feminist thought. Although her essay on the author's literary career is limited to two dramas, her
        introduction of Langner's life and works and her analysis of Frau Emma kempft im Hinterland and Klytemnestra mark an important first step in Langner scholarship. Sterzer discusses a great number of the dramas as period pieces, but, while her interpretation is certainly valid, this narrow context often has the effect of reducing Langner's dramas to mere alle gory. Kraft's most important contribution to Langner scholarship is in her assessment of Langner as a feminist. Kraft has been able to explain the apparent contradiction between Langner's openly feminist literature
        and the essentialist claims in her essays, letters, and diaries. </p>
        
        
         
         <p>Her interesting and insightful discussion of Langner suffers somewhat from the failure to consider Langner's later works. While all three of these scholars discuss Klytemnestra, along with several of Langner's other
        early dramas, none studies the development of the author and her works beyond the 1940s. This is a task that still needs to be undertaken.
        Langner's <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> is unique. The roles the author attributes to the title character differentiate her from previous depictions of the queen
        of My cene, especially in the emphasis on her role as ruler. Whereas early versions of this myth portray her either as a conniving character plotting to avenge <span class="name Iphigenia" > Iphigenia</span> 's death or as a passive mother mourning this same loss, Langner introduces a woman committed to ruling My cene under the principles of peace. No longer is <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> merely a
        tool in the propagation of the <span class="name Atrides/Atreus"> Atrides  </span> myth; she is now the subject of her own story. Although some of these features, such as the centrality of
        the woman in the text, can be seen in other modern revisions of the myth, Langner's innovations go much further. <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s ultimate goal, to create a world no longer ruled by the primacy of war, heroism,
        and gender inequality, reflects Langner's own personal quest for an
        alternative to the patriarchal society that spawned two world wars during her lifetime.
        Since <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> ascended the throne in the literary works of the Greek poets, tales of her reign have fascinated readers. The way in which historical and especially literary depictions have regarded her
        service to the crown in  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s absence, however, is far from complimentary; she "was.. .either seen as a vile murderer and thus demonized or was stylized as a seduced and suffering woman unable to act on her own accord" (Stephan 182). This ill-fated queen bears a large
        part of the guilt for continuing the curse that threatens the house of <span class="name Atrides/Atreo"> Atrides  </span>. Although the curse began generations before the judgment of <span class="name Paris" > Paris</span>, Clytemnestra plays a crucial role in its propagation. Famous for
        her infidelity during  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s ten-year absence and for his murder upon his return, <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> has belonged among the damned in western civilization. "In the Christian tradition perhaps only Eve rivals
        Klytemnestra's reputations [sic] as a destructive female. Eve, however, is the instrument of the fortunate fall, whereas Klytemnestra's deeds remain unredeemed in the patriarchal tradition" (Komar 20).5 Langner's
        drama sets out to question that tradition.
        Klytemnestra belongs to the tradition of modern revisions that have
        been "wrenched from the patriarchal grip by contemporary women writers and returned to the hands of the female" (Komar 20).</p>

        <p>These revisionist authors do not alter the outcome of  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s fateful reunion with his wife,6 but they do shift the focus from  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> to <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>.
        Viewing the character as subject rather than object, they explore the question of <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s motive in committing the murder
        that perpetuates the curse on the house of <span class="name Atrides/Atreo"> Atrides  </span>. This interest in motive stands in stark contrast to traditional depictions of the myth, dating as far back as the original dramatic versions, in which, as Kete Hamburger argues,
        it was not central to the dramatic interest how <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> came to the act of murder; her function is primarily to have completed the act and to have been defined by it. Even when the deed is moti
        vated, mostly by revenge for <span class="name Iphigenia" > Iphigenia</span>'s sacrifice, the murder of her husband remains only the prehistory to the matricide (31).
        This holds true even for Langner's contemporary Gerhart Hauptmann and his House of <span class="name Atrides/Atreo"> Atrides  </span> tetralogy. His ultimate interest, as it was for authors from Euripides to Sartre, was in the children of  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> and <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> (Hamburger 30).
        Two modern German revisions by women, discussed by Komar in 1994, deal with the question of motive. Both Christa Reinig in Entman nung: die Geschichte Ottos und seiner vier Frauen erzehlt von Christa
        Reinig (Castration: The Story of Otto and His Four Women as Told by Christa Reinig, 1976) and Christine Breckner in "Bist du nun glecklich, toter Agamemnon?" (Are You Happy Now, Dead  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>?, 1981) explain <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s transgressions by offering "psychological motiva
        tion for Klytemnestra's violence that makes her murder of  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>
        justifiable homicide or even a valiant act of justice" (Komar 21). This motivation comes, in the examples given by Komar, from identifying
        <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> as a victim. By showing her to be "an abused woman finally liberating herself from her abuser," Reinig and Breckner are able to present the character in a more positive light (Komar 22). While, as
        Komar argues, these revisions should certainly be considered feminist, they still take place within the confines of patriarchy. In both texts, the
         <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> figure maintains his centrality and there is no escape from the male-dominated world. In Breckner's text, for example, Clytem
        nestra's words are not only directed at her dead husband, they are also a reaction to his actions in life. She has not yet broken his connection to her, nor has she separated herself from him.
        Langner's retelling of the myth stands in stark contrast to male re writings of the tale. Her <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> has become the subject and not merely an agent whose sole purpose is to propel the story forward. It
        also differs from those feminist revisions studied by Komar in that neither motive nor justification stands at the center of the drama.</p>
         
        <p>Klytemnestra is not about the murder of  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>, even though that is
        the title figure's final deed at the end of the drama. Rather, as the title openly states, this is about the queen herself.7 Langner even omits one character normally associated with the tale of  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s home coming to further soften the question of motivation. Without the charac
        ter of <span class="name Cassandra" >  Cassandra</span>, jealousy disappears as a motive for killing Agamem non. <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s own deeds and actions form the context of the drama, not as they relate to or are dictated by the patriarchy, but rather as they are based on her own choices within the alternative society she created in her husband's absence and her attempts to preserve it after his
        return. In contrast to tradition, Langner's Klytemnestra depicts a "strong, self-confident and positively portrayed woman" (Stephan 182), a woman who defied all stereotypes and strove to integrate the principles of peace growth and prosperity into the patriarchy left behind by her
        spouse, thereby creating an alternative to the war-centered society. At first glance it seems as if Langner, through her portrayal of Clytem nestra, has created a matriarchy based on essentialist female character
        istics, but a closer look reveals much more depth. As Sterzer astutely notes, Langner's "heroine destroys the traditional pattern of femininity.
        With <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>, Langner contradicts the opinion that women are more peaceful and less aggressive than men" (226). While Langner does
        portray what superficially appears to be an idyllic world created by the ruling queen, she does not defy the tradition of the myth by suggesting a Utopian end to the drama. <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> is, true to literary history, des tined for a fall. In the drama, however, the fall stems not from the mur der of  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>, but rather from her inability to sustain her regime after the return of the patriarch.
        Langner begins her drama on the eve of  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s return to My cene. During the ten years of his absence, <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> has taken
        over her husband's rule and in doing so has completely transformed the
        kingdom. With the help of her lover, A <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span>, she has created a new <span class="place Mycene" > Mycene</span> based on the principles of peace and fertility; under her ten
        years of leadership the country has flourished as never before. Upon  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s return, <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> is ready to forgive her husband for sacrificing <span class="name Iphigenia" > Iphigenia</span>, and, provided he gives up the weapons of war, to
        rule by his side as an equal in the new <span class="place Mycene" > Mycene</span>. Although the war-weary  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> gives serious consideration to his wife's suggestion, he is
        unable to master his jealousy. Demanding that she return to her wifely duties and that social order as he understands it be restored, he insists
        that the queen be tried publicly for her infidelity.</p>

        
       <p> He is certain that once she has been disgraced in front of her subjects, she will gladly and humbly return to her role as wife. <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>, upon learning of
         <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s plan, sends <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span> to kill her husband, fulfilling her fate as dictated by the mythical tradition.
        Three different types of society are suggested in Klytemnestra, each identified with a different character and principle.  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> repre sents the reigning patriarchy based on the principle of justice, whereas
        <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span> supports a primal mother cult dedicated to honoring the Ur mutter, a statue modeled in the image of the queen; <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s rule, based on peace and fruitfulness, seeks an alternative to both of these
        masculine models.8 This, as Sterzer explains, is not only the situation in Klytemnestra. In Amazonen and Dido as well, Langner "delivered dif ferent examples of how women react to their marginalization in [patri
        archal] history" (227).
        Of the three alternatives,  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s world most closely resem
        bles the world Langner was living in while working on her mythological dramas. It is an androcentric society firmly grounded on the concept of
        what  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> understands to be justice and, by extension, on war and revenge. In the name of justice he led the Greek troops to<span class="place Mycene" > Mycene</span> to avenge his cuckolded brother. Later, upon deciding to punish Clytem nestra for her infidelity,  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> once again uses justice as his battle cry, arguing that he did not fight the Trojan War to punish Helen, only to tolerate infidelity in his own home (154). Even during his absence,
         <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> maintains influence over <span class="place Mycene" > Mycene</span>. His name represents war and glory to his subjects, and, to her chagrin, <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> is unable to neutralize his influence. Their children use games to celebrate their father's famed heroism. Even the administrator, an outspoken proponent of <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>, must admit to the queen his appreciation for the role of
        war in society, deeming it to be "honorable" (113).
        In her father's absence, <span class="name Electra" > Electra</span> defends the primacy of the patriar
        chy and the glorification of war that accompanies it, describing how battle awakens the nobility of self-sacrificing heroism in men (107). <span class="name Electra" > Electra</span> is so entranced by the patriarchy that she even renounces her
        mother's biological role in conceiving her by identifying with <span class="name Athena">Athena</span>, born from <span class="name Zeus">Zeus</span> alone (106). Upon his return to <span class="place Mycene" > Mycene</span>,  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>
        is greeted by two children enraptured by war. <span class="name Orestes" > Orestes</span> proclaims to his war-weary father that he is enthralled by war and its tools and promises to prove himself a man in future battles. <span class="name Electra" > Electra</span> chimes in with curses
        of the peaceful freedom <span class="place Mycene" > Mycene</span> enjoyed under <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s rule: "Auch ich veracht' des Friedens trebe Ruh, / Die nie von Waffen blit
        zend ward erleuchtet!" (127).9 Weak and weary after ten years of battle,  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> is ready to concede that war and patriarchy are destructive forces and that women are as capable as men: "Im Krieg lehrt sie mich Frauenart erst schetzen! / Was wir als mennliches Gescheft gerehmt, /
        
        
         
        Lenkt sie in weiblich-weiser Ruhe weiter" (129).10 He even credits his wife for the influence her reason had on him during their separation,
        remembering how he often looked to her for guidance that never failed (130).  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s promise, however, that peace can never make him forget the horror of ten desolate years of war is short-lived (127).
        When he first arrives in <span class="place Mycene" > Mycene</span>,  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>, having endured the
        Trojan War, is ready to denounce war. The lasting effect of the war is clear as he relates the devastation it has caused on both land and sea
        (134). This sentiment changes, though, as soon as he recognizes the threat that <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> poses to his autonomy: "Ich ferchte fast, kem es / Zum Kampf mit dir, dae ich dir unterleg!" (134).11 Despite the lip service he pays to peace,  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> staunchly refuses to denounce the
        war effort in <span class="place Troy" > Troy</span>, defending the Greeks' need to punish <span class="name Paris" > Paris</span>'s adul
        tery, which he saw as a disgrace to all men (142). He is unable to see the contradiction between his words and his actions.
        Attempting to ward off bellicose sentiments,  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> is always aware of the difficulties of preserving peace in a patriarchal society built on the primacy of war. War has taught him to cherish peace, but peace has always led to war.  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> sees no end to this cycle (151-52).
        With his ultimate decision to publicly humiliate <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> for her infidelities during his absence,  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span> reasserts the need for the old social structure of the realm, despite his ambivalent feelings toward
        warfare, and signals the intended destruction of his wife's creation. This action stems from what Kraft correctly recognizes as a dichotomy in
         <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s thought: although he claims willingness to share power equally with his spouse and for a time believes in his own sincerityehe demands absolute sovereignty over <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s body (88). His goal
        is to use her public disgrace and the ensuing shame to reawaken the wife he once knew and understood.</p>

        <p> His idealistic vision of their future
        demonstrates his lack of understanding of his wife:
        Wenn wir dann alt sind, beide milde Greise, Sinnt sie wohl staunend ihrer Freiheit nach,
        Erzehlt den Enkeln dann von eigner Herrschaft, Als treumt' sie einer alten Sage nach,
        Und kann sich selbst nicht mehr verstehen (153).12
         <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s vision of a harmonious future with his wife reflects both his patriarchal prejudices towards women's roles in society and his fear
        that if women are given equality, they may surpass men.
        In contrast to  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>, <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span> not only believes in the
        superiority of <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s ability to rule; his is the only male voice in the drama that unequivocally refuses to accept patriarchy as the preferred model for society.</p>

        <p> of his enlightened view of wo men's roles, Kraft refers to him as the "new man" (88). Even though he supports the same principles as <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>, his methods differ greatly
        from hers. Superficially, <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span>' earth mother cult has many similari ties with <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s <span class="place Mycene" > Mycene</span>, because both promote lasting peace and the continuation of <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s rule. Here the similarities end.
        With the help of primal rituals and animal sacrifices, <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span> and his followers believe that they are supporting the queen's quest for a peace ful society, but their actions take place furtively under the cover of dark
        ness without the approval or even the knowledge of the queen. Having learned about <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span>'s betrayal of her trust,13 <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> confronts
        him: "Nicht Fehrer von Mykenes Mennerjugend, / Verfehrer werst du" (118) .14 <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span> attempts to convince his lover that his primal matriar chy plays an integral role in her creation of an alternative to the patriar
        chy. In fact, he argues that the creation of the Urmutter icon and its worship was the key to the queen's success, because the symbol was
        able to negate <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s negative traits and allow peace to flourish (119) . <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span> asserts that the abolition of patriarchy is impossible
        without reawakening the primal matriarchy, and thus the queen has sealed her fate.
        A distinct difference between <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span>'s ways of promoting peace and the queen's agenda can be seen in Langner's use of day and night
        imagery. While <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s world is defined by the primacy of light, as is demonstrated by her first line in the drama, "Hell gleht der Tag, ich mecht ihn frisch umarmen!"15 <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span> and his mother cult thrive under the darkness of night. Just as light is a guiding principle in Cly
        temnestra's enlightened regime, <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span> craves the darkness and the instinctual feelings that accompany it, claiming that light blinds him and that love is not a cognitive process (118). It was also under the cover of
        night that <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span> led his followers in a game he termed "Stab the Wolf" (Wolfstich), which entailed capturing predators symbols of the
        patriarchyein a web made of women's hair and artfully killing them with a single stab wound to the heart (167).16 <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>'s reaction to the animal sacrifices demonstrates her belief that modern society has outgrown such primal rituals, while  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s sacrifice of <span class="name Iphigenia" > Iphigenia</span>
        for the sake of war suggests that the patriarchy has not.</p>


        <p> <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span>'s alternative to  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s patriarchal society
        is not accepted as viable, based as it is not only on the worship of wo man and her essentialist qualities, but also on the exclusion of the object
        of worship, his arguments in support of <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> and the peace she is trying to maintain echo the queen's own. He refutes  <span class="name Agamemnon" > Agamemnon</span>'s
        support of the Trojan War, exposing the true, frivolous nature of the ten-year battle:
        Ja, ihr opfertet der eignen Rache Eure Velkereund fer Menelaos
        Starben Griechen, Veter, junge Menner, Deren Liebe nicht betrogen war! Dieser Krieg...
        Ist durch keinen blut'gen Zwang entschuldigt. Euer Land war nicht bedroht, verwestend Brach kein Feind in euren Frieden ein!
        "Helena!" hiee euer Kampfgeschrei! (142)17
        Even though <span class="name Aegisthus" > Aegisthus</span> and <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span> have similar goals, his primal matriarchal society is not an alternative for <span class="name Clytemnestra" > Clytemnestra</span>. As Sterzer
