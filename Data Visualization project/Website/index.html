      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>On March 15, 2019, Hong Kong started a series of protests against a proposed amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, 
        which would allow extradition to mainland China. 
        This sparked one of the biggest and longest protest movements in Hong Kong's history, 
        as citizens feared it would threaten the region's autonomy and legal protections.
        In the end, the extradition bill was withdrawn, 
        but the Chinese government tightened its unprecedented control over Hong Kong since 1997 (The Handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China), 
        by introduction of the national security law. </p>
        <p>This social movement set a record for the largest peaceful march, 
          with an estimated 2 million participants (the population of Hong Kong is 7.5 million).
          Despite the strong resistance, but the outcome has led to a great undermining of freedom and democracy in Hong Kong. 
          The result is that the departure of approximately 400,000 Hong Kong residents after those events.</p>
      <p>This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of the unique protests, discovering their unique features. </p>
      <h5 id="small">The title is a lyric from <span class="italic">"今夜雪糕" (Tonight's Ice Cream)</span>, a song that expresses feelings about the protests, by the Hong Kong band <span class="italic">My Little Airport</span>. </p>

      <h2>Data Overview</h2>
      <p>The project  relies on two main datasets: </p>
      <p><span class="bold">ACLED Dataset</span>: This dataset includes detailed records of protest events in Hong Kong from March 15, 2019, to June 30, 2020. It is the main dataset for this project.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">LOD Dataset</span>: This dataset provides crossed context and data related to specific protest events in Hong Kong.</p>

      <div id="bar_plot">
        <h3>Bar Plot</h3>
        <p><span class="bold">Bar chart</span> is a good choice to do event type comparison. Since it is easy to see the different values of different categories.</p>
        <div class="bar chart">
          <img src="/Viz/barplot_type.png" alt="bar chart for compare types">
          <p><span class="bold">Description</span>: This bar chart compares the event types of two categories, we can see <u>Protests</u> are common in both related and non-related contexts, with 414 and 486 values. 
            In contrast, <u>Riots</u> are more frequent in events related to the movement, with 189 compared to just 25 in non-related events.

        <div class="bar chart">
          <img src="/Viz/barplot_subtype.png" alt="bar chart for compare subtypes">
          <p><span class="bold">Description</span>: This bar chart compares the sub-event types of two categories, The most common sub-event type is <u>Peaceful protests</u>,  with 368 related to movement and 474 not related. 
            In contrast, <u>Violent Demonstation</u> has 189 events related to and only 25 not related. In <u>protests with intervention</u>, it occurs more frequently in related events, with 43 occurrences compared to 11 in non related events.
            <u>Excessive Force Against Protesters</u> are relatively rare.

        <div class="result">
          <p><span class="bold">Conclusion:</span></p>
          <p>1.Events related to the movement tend to have a higher incidence of violent and intervention-related sub-events compared to those not related to the movement.</p>
          <p>2.The relatively higher number of protests with intervention in related events suggests a greater involvement of law enforcement in these contexts.</p>
          <p>3.While peaceful protests are common in both contexts, violent demonstrations and riots are more strongly associated with events related to the movement.</p>

        <h3>Line Plot</h3>
        <p>The project used <span class="bold">line chart</span> to show the temporal trends. 
          they provide timeline of protests in Hong Kong, to distinguish between protests related to the movement and those are not. 
          The x-axis is the date, from 2019 March to 2020 June, And the y-axis is the number.</p>

            <p><b>Description</b>:
              The green line (related to extradition protests)  shows significant peaks in June, July, November 2019, and June 2020. 
              Additionally, it has a decline in activities at the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020.
              The orange line(not related to extradition protests) displays fewer peaks, 
              indicating a more even distribution of activities throughout the period.

          <p><b>Description</b>: 
            The green line (related to extradition protests) shows little but significant peaks, 
            particularly a massive spike in November 2019.
            The orange line (not related to extradition protests) remains consistently low, with a few and minor peaks.

        <div class="result">
          <p><span class="bold">Conclusion:</span></p>
            <p>1.Both peaceful and violent protests are primarily related to the extradition bill.</p>
            <p>2.External factors strongly influence protests related to the extradition bill, 
              such as high activities each June, which aligns with the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, 
              and decreased activities during early 2020, which aligns with the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
            <p>3.There is a temporal relation between peaceful and violent protests, 
              which peaks in peaceful protests are often accompanied by peaks in violent protests.</p>

          Each district is shaded according to the number of protests, with a gradient color scale indicating the intensity from lighter to darker shades.
          <br/>The district of <u>Yau Tsim Mong</u> has the highest concentration of protests, making it the primary hotspot for protest activities in Hong Kong.
          <u>Kwun Tong, Wan Chai and Sha Tin </u>also show a high number of protests.

          <p><span class="bold">Conclusion:</span></p>
            <p>The geographic distribution of protests in Hong Kong reveals that protests are most heavily concentrated in the districts of Yau Tsim Mong, 
            Kwun Tong, Wan Chai, Sha Tin, and Eastern. Yau Tsim Mong, in particular, stands out as the primary hub of protest activities.</p>
