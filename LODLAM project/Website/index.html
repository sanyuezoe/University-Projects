                    <p>In January 2022, a heartbreaking video surfaced on <a class="p-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok#Douyin">Douyin</a>, 
                        exposing the plight of <a class="p-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuzhou_chained_woman_incident">a woman chained to a wall</a> in a decaying hut by her so-called “husband” during a cold winter in a rural Chinese village. 
                        Dressed in rags, her face smeared with dirt, and her teeth missing. People heard that she might have whispered phrases like, 
                        <span class="italic"> “They are all rapists”</span> and <span class="italic"> “The world has abandoned me.”</span> The video sparked widespread outrage, 
                        and many suspected that she was a victim of human trafficking, driving urgent calls for a government investigation.</p>
                    <p>On January 28, 2022, the local government <a class="p-link" href="https://news.cctv.com/2022/01/28/ARTIhtyL3a4nSwoH1IQ3AvHa220128.shtml">initially responded</a>, attributing her condition to mental illness and denying any connection to human trafficking. 
                        Yet, with conflicting information in the official statements, the public began their own search for the truth, 
                        pressing for clarity from higher authorities. However, each official response only deepened suspicions, 
                        leading to further demands for transparency.</p>
                    <p>As the case gained traction, widespread censorship activity followed. Online discussions were aggressively suppressed; 
                        journalists faced police intimidation, and two women who attempted to help were detained. 
                        <a class="p-link" href="http://www.news.cn/politics/2022-02/23/c_1128407989.htm">The final report</a>, released by the Jiangsu provincial team on February 23, 2022, 
                        failed to resolve the doubts due to its inconsistencies, and discussion on the matter was eventually prohibited.</p>
                    <p>To this day, uncertainty lingers over the woman’s true identity, her story, and her current situation. 
                        This Linked Open Data Project is dedicated to documenting these voices and preserving this history, 
                        preventing them from being forgotten by society.</p>

                    <p>Since this event was spread out mostly in digital spaces, most of the resources are from online platforms and social media. 
                        Additionally, due to the sensitivity of the project and <a class="p-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_China">the censorship in China,</a> 
                        the original resources for most of the items have been deleted. 
                        Therefore, I rely on republished versions and screenshots provided by other individuals/groups. </p>
                    <p>While I try to offer descriptions from cultural institutions or authoritative sources, 
                        these are often <a class="p-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media_in_China">controlled by the Chinese government</a>. 
                        Therefore, my descriptions aim to provide accuracy and avoid using official narratives.

                </div>   
                <p>Unlike traditional projects that rely on academic or authoritative archival providers, 
                    this project's items are mainly from online platforms. 
                    Also, due to the sensitive and censorship nature of the project, 
                    much of the content has been re-uploaded on alternative platforms. Although uncommon, 
                    this approach preserves the incident's authenticity as it was experienced in real-time. 
                    Because of that, I have selected metadata standards for each item’s type. Given their web-based and shareable nature, 
                    <span class="bold">Schema.org</span> standards are used for digital texts and media. 
                    <span class="bold">MODS</span> for text-based records, <span class="bold">LIDO</span> for art and exhibition materials, and <span class="bold">IPTC</span> for digital images.</p>
                <p>To increase credibility, 
                    I enrich metadata by linking items to available <span class="bold">authoritative sources</span> if possible and use the <span class="bold">provenance</span> of items to show the item’s origin.</p>
