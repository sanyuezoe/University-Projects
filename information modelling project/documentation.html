            <h1>Art Nouveau Style</h1>
            <h2>A Brief Overview</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau">Art Nouveaustyle</a>  employed in this website draws inspiration from the late 19th-century artistic movement, 
              particularly the works of Czech artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Mucha">Alphonse Mucha</a>.</p>
            <p>Art Nouveau, also known as the Modern Style, 
              emerged as a significant artistic movement between 1890 and 1910. 
              It aimed to establish a wholly unique style that diverged from previous artistic eras, 
              breaking away from imitation. </p>
            <p><b>Key Features of Art Nouveau:</b></p>
            <p><b>Asymmetry</b>: Art Nouveau embraces asymmetry, avoiding the rigid symmetry of previous styles.</p>
            <p><b>Plenty of Female Images</b>: Art Nouveau is characterized by an abundance of female images. 
              This aligns seamlessly with our website's focus on portraying women's images.</p>
            <p><b>Sinuous Lines</b>: It features sinuous, flowing lines inspired by forms found in nature.</p>
            <p><b>Decorative Organic Forms</b>: The style incorporates decorative elements derived from animals,
               flowers, and plants.</p>
            <br>
    
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">FONTS:</span></p>
            <P>Primary Font - <span class="bold">Rochester</span>: The primary font, 
              used for titles and the navbar.</p>
            <p>Our selection of the 'Rochester' font for our Art Nouveau-inspired project draws inspiration from the Art Nouveau movement's characteristic features. 
              While Art Nouveau didn't establish specific fonts, 
              it left a distinct mark on typography, emphasizing curved and organic shapes and a penchant for high ornamentation. 
              The 'Rochester' font aligns with these principles, with its flowing lines, ornate details, and elegant script.</p>
            <div class="img-combo">
              <img src="img/art-n-fontstyle.png" alt="Art Nouveau fontstyle">
              <p class="italic">Ver Sacrum illustration by Koloman Moser (1899)</p>
            </div>
            <p>By choosing 'Rochester,' we aim to capture the essence of Art Nouveau and infuse our design with a sense of vintage elegance and sophistication. 
              While the font may not be a direct product of the era, it serves as a bridge between the past and the present, 
              allowing us to create a visually pleasing and harmonious result. 
              It's our way of paying homage to Art Nouveau's timeless charm while giving our project a contemporary twist.</p>
            <p class="italic">Example of title in the Rochester font:</p>
            <div class="img-combo">

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Secondary Font - <span class="bold">Antic Didone</span>: For regular text content.
            <p>strikes the balance between readability and Art Nouveau elegance. 
              Its soft, curved style ensures legibility while maintaining the vintage aesthetic.</p>
              <p class="italic"> Example of text in the Antic Didone font:</p>
              <div class="img-combo">
                <img src="img/Antic-Didone.png" alt="Antic-Didone Example ">
              </div>
            <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p>In the Art Nouveau style, particularly exemplified by Alphonse Mucha's iconic works,
              color plays a pivotal role.he likes to use muted and earthy tones, 
              adds delicate and gentle accents to his works, 
              and usually draws inspiration from the natural world. 
              he also likes to use Gold and Metallic Accents to enhance the luxurious and ornate quality,  
              to highlight specific elements. </p>
            <div class="img-combo">
              <img src="img/musha-collection.png" alt="musha collection">
            </div>
            <p>Here are chosen colors for the style:</p>
            <p>The color palette employed in the website design aims to evoke a sense of softness and harmony.
               The primary background color, Light Pink (#f9efea), blankets the entire website, 
               enveloping it in a gentle and soothing ambiance.
               Complementing this, 
               various light shades are strategically integrated to maintain a soft and inviting tone throughout the site.</p>
            <p>To add depth and contrast, a range of different grey hues is artfully woven into the design. 
              These greys create a harmonious balance with the other colors, 
              providing visual interest while preserving an overall sense of tranquility.</p>
            <p>Notably, a touch of gold is introduced for the 'hr' element, 
              paying homage to the golden threads found in books of the Art Nouveau era. 
              This subtle gilded detail adds a touch of elegance and historical reference to the design, 
              enriching the overall aesthetic.</p>

            <h2>Layout and others</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">LAYOUT:</span></p>
            <p>Incorporating nature-inspired elements is a hallmark of Art Nouveau. 
              In our design, we utilize floral and plant imagery to enhance the overall aesthetics:</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Floral Borders:</span> Flower and plant images are elegantly incorporated as borders for dropdown menus,
               lending a decorative and organic touch.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Cursor:</span> The cursor is designed to resemble a flower, 
              adding a unique and thematic element that aligns seamlessly with the Art Nouveau style.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Female Images:</span> Alphonse Mucha's iconic female images are featured as covers and button images,
               personifying glamour, modernity, and beauty, 
               which perfectly aligns with the Art Nouveau theme.</p>
